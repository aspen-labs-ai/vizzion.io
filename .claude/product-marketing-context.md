# Product Marketing Context

*Last updated: February 7, 2026 (expanded to 17 industries)*

---

## Product Overview

**One-liner:** Vizzion is a product visualization widget that turns website visitors into qualified leads by letting customers see products on their actual property, vehicle, or body before sharing their contact info.

**What it does:** Customers visit a business's website, upload a photo of their property, vehicle, or themselves, and instantly see a photo-realistic rendering of products (solar panels, new roofing, vehicle wraps, tattoo designs, etc.) applied to their actual photo. To view the full visualization, they enter their email — generating an exclusive, pre-qualified lead for the business. The entire experience is embeddable, white-label, and takes under 5 minutes to set up.

**Product category:** Lead generation / website conversion tool for home improvement and adjacent visual industries. Sits at the intersection of "lead generation software," "website widget," and "product visualization tool." Customers search for terms like "solar lead generation tool," "roofing website widget," "home improvement lead capture," "vehicle wrap preview tool," "tattoo visualization widget."

**Product type:** B2B SaaS — embeddable website widget.

**Business model:** Subscription SaaS. Home improvement companies embed the widget on their website. Tiered pricing based on visualization volume. Free tier available for smaller companies to test. Premium plans scale with traffic. Pricing details TBD.

## Target Audience

**Target companies:** Businesses across 17 verticals in home improvement and adjacent visual industries. Ranges from small local contractors and shops to mid-market regional companies. They have a website with existing traffic but poor conversion rates.

*Home Improvement (12 verticals):* Solar installers, roofing contractors, siding companies, window & door dealers, decking builders, fencing companies, landscapers, painting contractors, gutter installers, garage door companies, outdoor lighting businesses, and flooring/countertop specialists.

*Beyond Home Improvement (5 verticals):* Car/vehicle wrap shops, tattoo studios, swimming pool installers, artificial turf companies, and boat decking specialists.

**The common thread:** Any business where the customer needs to *see the product on their specific thing* (home, car, body, yard, boat) before committing. If visualization bridges the uncertainty gap, Vizzion fits.

**Decision-makers:**
- Business owners (most common — they wear multiple hats)
- Marketing managers / directors at larger companies
- Sales managers frustrated with lead quality
- Operations managers looking to reduce cost per acquisition

**Primary use case:** Converting anonymous website visitors into identified, pre-qualified leads by offering an interactive product visualization experience that captures email before revealing the result.

**Jobs to be done:**
- "Generate more leads from the website traffic I'm already paying for"
- "Give homeowners a reason to engage with my website instead of bouncing"
- "Get higher-quality leads that actually close, not tire-kickers"

**Use cases:**
- Solar installer embeds widget on homepage → homeowners see panels on their roof → installer captures 5–10× more leads from same traffic
- Roofing contractor adds widget to landing page → homeowners compare shingle styles on their actual home → contractor gets exclusive leads with roof photos attached
- Siding company deploys widget across service area pages → each page becomes an interactive lead gen machine instead of a static brochure
- Multi-trade home improvement company uses widget across multiple product pages (roofing, siding, windows) → single tool serves entire business
- Vehicle wrap shop embeds widget on gallery page → car owners upload a photo of their vehicle, see custom wrap designs applied → shop captures leads from browsers who were "just looking"
- Tattoo studio adds widget to their website → clients upload a photo of their arm, back, or leg and preview tattoo designs on their actual skin → artist captures warm leads who've already committed mentally to the design
- Swimming pool installer deploys widget on their homepage → homeowners upload a backyard photo and see pool shapes, decking, and landscaping rendered in place → installer gets leads from homeowners who can finally picture it
- Artificial turf company uses widget on service area pages → homeowners see their patchy lawn replaced with lush turf → company captures leads from visitors who just wanted to "see what it would look like"

## Personas

| Persona | Role | Cares About | Challenge | Value We Promise |
|---------|------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **Owner-Operator** | Small business owner who runs everything | ROI, simplicity, not wasting money on tools that don't work | "I'm spending a fortune on bought leads that don't convert. My website is basically a brochure." | More leads from your existing traffic at zero marginal cost. 5-minute setup, no developer needed. |
| **Marketing Manager** | Manages digital marketing at a mid-size company | Conversion rates, cost per lead, campaign performance metrics | "We drive traffic with SEO and ads but our website converts at 2–3%. Leadership wants more leads without more ad spend." | Transform your website from a digital brochure into an interactive lead generation machine. Measurable lift in conversion rate. |
| **Sales Manager** | Leads a team of sales reps | Lead quality, close rates, speed to lead, pipeline velocity | "My reps waste hours chasing garbage leads. We need warmer prospects who are actually ready to talk." | Every lead has already visualized the product on their home and opted in. These leads close at 2–3× the rate of bought leads. |
| **Operations / GM** | Oversees P&L at a larger company | Customer acquisition cost, scalability, competitive advantage | "Our CAC keeps climbing. We need a scalable way to generate exclusive leads without hiring more reps." | Reduce CAC by generating self-qualified leads 24/7. Works while your team sleeps. Scales with traffic, not headcount. |
| **Wrap Shop Owner** | Owns/operates a vehicle wrap or graphics shop | Standing out from competitors, showcasing design capability, reducing "just looking" browsers | "People browse our gallery but never reach out. They can't picture a wrap on *their* car so they leave." | Let customers see wraps on their actual vehicle before they call. Turns browsers into booked appointments. |
| **Tattoo Studio Owner** | Owns/manages a tattoo studio or is a high-volume independent artist | Booking pipeline, reducing no-shows, attracting serious clients vs. tire-kickers | "Half my DM inquiries ghost me. They're not sure about placement or size and they bail." | Clients preview designs on their own body. By the time they book, they're committed — fewer ghosts, faster bookings. |

## Problems & Pain Points

**Core problem:** 97%+ of website visitors in visual industries leave without converting. Customers are curious about products but can't picture what they'd look like on their specific property, vehicle, or body — so they bounce. The "uncertainty gap" between interest and action is too wide for a static contact form to bridge.

**Why current solutions fall short:**
- **Bought/shared leads** ($50–$150 each) are sold to 3–5 competitors simultaneously. It becomes a speed-to-lead foot race where the fastest dialer wins, not the best company. Close rates on bought leads average 5–10%.
- **Static contact forms** ("Get a Free Quote!") have sky-high friction. Homeowners don't want to commit to a sales conversation just to explore. 2–3% conversion rate is the norm.
- **Chatbots and live chat** interrupt the browsing experience and still require the homeowner to initiate a conversation they're not ready for.
- **Existing visualization tools** (Aurora Solar, OpenSolar, Hover) are post-lead tools designed for sales reps to use during or after a consultation. They do nothing to capture the lead in the first place.
- **Quote calculators** give a number but don't help the homeowner see the product on their home — the #1 thing that moves them from curious to committed.

**What it costs them:**
- $3,000–$6,000+ customer acquisition cost per closed deal (solar industry benchmark)
- Thousands of dollars/month on lead aggregators delivering shared, low-quality leads
- Lost revenue from the 97% of visitors who leave without converting
- Sales team hours wasted on unqualified prospects who don't pick up the phone
- Competitive disadvantage as other companies adopt better engagement tools

**Emotional tension:**
- Frustration: "We're bleeding money on leads that go nowhere"
- Anxiety: "Our competitors are getting smarter and we're falling behind"
- Helplessness: "We get traffic but can't figure out how to convert it"
- Skepticism: "We've tried every lead-capture gimmick — chatbots, quizzes, pop-ups — nothing moves the needle"

---

## Competitive Landscape

**Direct competitors:** None. No tool on the market focuses specifically on pre-lead website visitor conversion through interactive product visualization. Vizzion occupies a whitespace position.

**Secondary competitors (post-lead tools — different solution, same customer):**
- **Aurora Solar** — #1 solar design software. "One platform to sell, design, finance, and deliver solar." Enterprise-focused, complex, used by sales reps after lead capture. Does nothing for website conversion. Falls short: requires a sales conversation first; homeowner never interacts with it directly on the company's website.
- **OpenSolar** — Free solar design software with community positioning. Same limitation: it's a proposal/design tool activated after you have the lead.
- **Solargraf** — Solar proposal and design tool. "Elevate your workflow." Post-lead, rep-facing.
- **Hover** — 3D property modeling for construction/renovation. Scan-to-model workflow for contractors. Proves visualization sells in home improvement but is a contractor tool, not a consumer-facing lead gen widget.
- **EagleView / GAF QuickMeasure** — Aerial imagery and measurement tools. Enterprise geospatial data. Not relevant to small/mid installers' website conversion needs.
- **Roofr** — Closest analog to Vizzion's model. Their "Instant Estimator" widget lets homeowners get roof estimates on a contractor's website, capturing leads. However, Roofr focuses on estimation/pricing, not visual product previews. Different mechanism, similar go-to-market.

**Indirect competitors (what they do instead):**
- Static contact forms ("Get a Free Quote") — low conversion, high friction
- Chatbots (Drift, Intercom) — interrupt browsing, still require conversation
- Quote/savings calculators — give a number but don't help visualize
- Lead aggregators (EnergySage, Modernize, Angi) — shared leads, expensive, declining quality
- Google LSA / paid ads — drive traffic but don't solve the conversion problem

**How each falls short:** Every alternative either (a) requires the homeowner to commit to a sales conversation before seeing anything, or (b) generates shared/low-quality leads at high cost, or (c) fails to bridge the "uncertainty gap" — the homeowner's inability to picture the product on their specific home.

---

## Differentiation

**Key differentiators:**
- **Pre-lead, not post-lead** — The only visualization tool that works on the company's public website to capture leads. Every competitor activates after a lead is already in the pipeline.
- **Email gate before visualization** — The homeowner enters their email to see the result. This is the conversion mechanism: they get value (seeing their home with the product), you get their contact info. Both sides win.
- **Exclusive, self-generated leads** — Every lead belongs solely to the company. No sharing, no bidding wars, no racing to the phone. The homeowner engaged with your brand, on your site.
- **Zero marginal cost per lead** — Leads come from existing website traffic. No per-lead fees, no ad spend required.
- **5-minute setup, no developer needed** — Single embed snippet. Works on any website (WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, custom). Fully white-label.
- **Cross-industry** — Works for 17+ verticals across home improvement and beyond. Same widget, different product visualizations. One platform serves solar, roofing, vehicle wraps, tattoo studios, and more.

**How we solve it differently:** Instead of waiting for the homeowner to fill out a generic form or call, Vizzion gives them something genuinely valuable first — a realistic preview of the product on their actual home. The email capture is the exchange: they give contact info, they get to see the visualization. This flips the traditional lead gen model from "give us your info and we'll contact you" to "see your home transformed — just enter your email."

**Why that's better:** Homeowners who have already visualized a product on their home are warmer, more engaged, and significantly easier to close. They've self-qualified through investment of time and attention. The sales conversation starts from "I've already seen what it looks like and I'm interested" rather than "So tell me about your company."

**Why customers choose us over alternatives:** "We tried everything — contact forms, chatbots, bought leads. Vizzion is different because it gives the homeowner something genuinely valuable before asking for anything. They see their home with the product. That changes the conversation completely."

## Objections & Anti-Personas

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Is this hard to set up?" | One embed snippet, under 5 minutes. Works on any website — WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, custom. No developer or IT team needed. |
| "Will it slow down my website?" | Lightweight widget that loads asynchronously. Zero impact on page speed or Core Web Vitals. |
| "Does it actually generate leads?" | [Case study with specific numbers — e.g., "120+ leads/month from existing traffic, 22% close rate vs. 8% on bought leads"] |
| "I already use Aurora / OpenSolar" | Vizzion isn't a replacement — it's the missing piece. Aurora designs the system after you have the lead. Vizzion captures the lead in the first place. They're complementary. |
| "My customers aren't tech-savvy" | If they can take a photo with their phone, they can use Vizzion. That's it. |
| "How much does it cost?" | Tiered pricing starting with a free tier. Most companies see positive ROI within the first week — one closed deal covers months of Vizzion. |
| "We've tried lead capture gimmicks before" | Chatbots and pop-ups ask for info without giving anything. Vizzion gives homeowners something valuable — a realistic preview of their home — then asks for their email. It's an exchange, not a gimmick. |
| "What about bad/low-quality photos?" | The system handles a wide range of image quality — phone photos, Google Maps screenshots, slightly angled shots. For extremely unclear images, it prompts for a better photo. |

**Anti-persona (who is NOT a good fit):**
- Companies with no website traffic (Vizzion converts existing traffic — it doesn't generate traffic)
- Businesses that sell non-visual products or services (consulting, inspections, etc.)
- Enterprise companies with complex procurement cycles who need 6-month pilots (Vizzion is built for speed)
- Companies that already have more leads than they can handle (rare, but exists)

---

## Switching Dynamics

**Push (frustrations driving them away from current approach):**
- Bought leads are expensive, shared, and declining in quality
- Website converts at 2–3% despite decent traffic
- Sales team wastes hours on unqualified prospects
- Cost per acquisition keeps climbing year over year
- "Every solar company's website looks the same — we can't differentiate"
- Competitors are adopting smarter engagement tools

**Pull (what attracts them to Vizzion):**
- Exclusive leads from their own traffic at zero marginal cost
- Interactive experience that differentiates their website from competitors
- Pre-qualified prospects who've already visualized the product
- 5-minute setup — instant gratification
- White-label — looks like a native feature of their website
- Works 24/7, no additional headcount needed

**Habit (what keeps them stuck with current approach):**
- "We've always bought leads — it's what we know"
- Existing contracts with lead aggregators
- Inertia — changing anything on the website feels risky
- "Our website is fine, we just need more traffic" (misdiagnosis)
- Comfort with the status quo even when it's expensive

**Anxiety (worries about switching to Vizzion):**
- "What if homeowners don't actually use it?"
- "Is this just another tool we'll pay for and never use?"
- "What if the visualizations don't look good?"
- "Will it really integrate with our CRM?"
- "Are we early adopters on something unproven?"

### Beyond Home Improvement — Industry Notes

**13. Car / Vehicle Wraps**
- **Customer:** Wrap shops, graphics/sign companies that do fleet and personal vehicle wraps.
- **End user:** Car enthusiasts, small business owners wanting fleet branding, people considering color-change wraps.
- **Visualization:** Customer uploads a photo of their vehicle → sees wrap designs, colors, or branded graphics applied.
- **Uncertainty gap:** Wraps are expensive ($2K–$5K+). Customers can't picture a design on *their* specific car — especially color changes or custom patterns. They browse gallery pages and leave.
- **Pain points:** "People look at our portfolio but can't imagine it on their car." High quote-request abandonment. Hard to differentiate from other wrap shops online.
- **Language:** Wrap, color change, partial wrap, full wrap, fleet graphics, PPF, matte, gloss, satin, chrome delete.
- **Competitive landscape:** No direct competitor does pre-lead vehicle wrap visualization. Mock-up tools (like Boxshot, vehicle templates in Photoshop) are designer-facing, not consumer-facing website widgets.
- **SEO terms:** "vehicle wrap preview tool," "car wrap visualizer," "see wraps on my car," "fleet wrap lead generation."

**14. Tattoos**
- **Customer:** Tattoo studios, independent tattoo artists with their own websites/booking pages.
- **End user:** People considering a tattoo — especially first-timers or people adding to existing work.
- **Visualization:** Client uploads a photo of the body area (arm, back, leg, etc.) → sees tattoo designs rendered on their actual skin.
- **Uncertainty gap:** Tattoos are permanent. The #1 hesitation is "will it look right on me, in that spot, at that size?" Clients ghost artists after initial inquiries because they can't commit without seeing it.
- **Pain points:** High no-show and ghost rates on consultations. DM inquiries that go nowhere. Artists spend hours on custom sketches for clients who never book.
- **Language:** Flash, custom piece, sleeve, placement, line work, blackwork, realism, traditional, neo-trad, consultation, deposit.
- **Competitive landscape:** Apps like InkHunter and TattooPreviewer exist but are consumer apps — not lead-gen tools for studios. No embeddable widget for tattoo studio websites.
- **SEO terms:** "tattoo preview tool," "see tattoo on my body," "tattoo studio lead generation," "tattoo visualization widget."

**15. Swimming Pools**
- **Customer:** Pool builders, pool installation companies, companies that do full backyard renovations including pools.
- **End user:** Homeowners considering an in-ground or above-ground pool installation.
- **Visualization:** Homeowner uploads a photo of their backyard → sees pool shapes, decking, and landscaping rendered in their actual yard.
- **Uncertainty gap:** Pools are a $30K–$100K+ purchase. Homeowners can't picture how a pool would fit in their specific yard, what shape works, or how it changes the space. They browse pool company websites but don't commit to a consultation.
- **Pain points:** Long sales cycles (3–6 months). Homeowners get quotes from multiple builders and ghost. Hard to stand out — every pool company shows the same stock photos of finished pools.
- **Language:** In-ground pool, fiberglass, gunite, vinyl liner, pool deck, coping, waterline tile, freeform, geometric, plunge pool, hot tub/spa.
- **Competitive landscape:** Pool design software (Pool Studio, Vip3D) exists but is post-lead — used by designers during the sales process. Nothing captures leads on the website through visualization.
- **SEO terms:** "pool visualization tool," "see a pool in my backyard," "pool builder lead generation," "backyard pool preview."

**16. Artificial Turf**
- **Customer:** Artificial turf / synthetic grass installation companies.
- **End user:** Homeowners tired of lawn maintenance, pet owners wanting durable yards, commercial property managers.
- **Visualization:** Homeowner uploads a photo of their lawn, patio, or pet area → sees it replaced with lush artificial turf.
- **Uncertainty gap:** "Will it look fake?" and "Will it actually look good in *my* yard?" are the two biggest objections. Stock photos of turf don't answer these questions for a specific property.
- **Pain points:** Homeowners are skeptical of the look/feel. High bounce rates on websites. Hard to convey the transformation from patchy real grass to finished turf without a visit.
- **Language:** Synthetic turf, artificial grass, pet turf, putting green, infill, drainage, blade height, turf roll, seam, natural look.
- **Competitive landscape:** No direct visualization competitors. Some companies offer before/after galleries but nothing interactive or personalized to the customer's yard.
- **SEO terms:** "artificial turf visualizer," "see turf on my lawn," "synthetic grass preview tool," "turf company lead generation."

**17. Boat Decking**
- **Customer:** Marine decking companies, boat restoration shops, companies selling synthetic boat deck materials (SeaDek, Marine Mat, etc.).
- **End user:** Boat owners considering re-decking or adding non-skid decking to their vessel.
- **Visualization:** Boat owner uploads a photo of their boat deck → sees new decking material, color, and pattern applied.
- **Uncertainty gap:** Boat decking is a significant investment. Owners want to see how a specific color/pattern looks on *their* boat before ordering. Color samples on a website don't capture the full picture.
- **Pain points:** Long decision cycles — boat owners browse for months. Hard to convey the transformation from worn-out deck to finished product. Competitors all show the same stock boat photos.
- **Language:** SeaDek, Marine Mat, EVA foam, helm pad, swim platform, non-skid, teak alternative, custom pattern, CNC-cut, adhesive-backed.
- **Competitive landscape:** No consumer-facing visualization tools exist in marine decking. Custom mock-ups are done manually by sales reps — slow and labor-intensive.
- **SEO terms:** "boat deck visualizer," "see decking on my boat," "marine decking preview tool," "boat decking lead generation."
