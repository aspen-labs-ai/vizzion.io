    paragraphs: [
      `Water restrictions across California, Arizona, Nevada, Texas, and Colorado are driving record demand for artificial turf. Municipalities are banning new sod in residential developments. Utility rebates of $1 to $3 per square foot are paying homeowners to rip out natural grass. The average residential install runs $8,000 to $15,000 — and for larger yards or commercial work, it scales fast. If you're a turf installer, the demand is there. The question is whether your website is capturing it.`,
      `For most installers, the answer is no. Your site has project photos and a contact form — the same setup every contractor uses. Conversion rates sit around 2 to 4 percent. The problem is straightforward: turf is a visual product, and homeowners can't picture it on their yard. Their yard has slopes, shade, garden beds, a cracked patio. Will turf look natural there? That uncertainty is the reason they browse and bounce instead of picking up the phone.`,
      `There's no visualization tool built for the turf industry. Measurement software, infill calculators, CRM platforms — the rest of your sales stack has tools. But the top of the funnel, where a homeowner is Googling "artificial turf cost" and deciding whether to request a quote, has nothing. That's the gap Vizzion fills.`,

      question: "How long does it take to set up Vizzion on my turf company website?",
      answer:
        `Under five minutes. You copy one embed snippet and drop it on your project gallery, a dedicated "See Turf on Your Lawn" landing page, or even a page targeting local rebate traffic like "Las Vegas Turf Rebate — See It First." No developer needed. Most turf installers have it live and capturing leads before their next crew finishes a backyard.`,

    {
      question: "How much does Vizzion cost for turf installers?",
      answer:
        "There's a free tier so you can test it with real traffic before spending a dollar. Paid plans are based on monthly visualization volume. When your average install runs $8K to $15K, a single closed deal covers months of the widget — compare that to burning $50 to $150 per shared lead on HomeAdvisor where you're bidding against four other installers for the same drought-motivated homeowner.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does the visualization show different turf styles or blade types?",
      answer:
        "The preview generates a realistic rendering of lush, natural-looking synthetic turf on the homeowner's actual yard. The goal is to show them what the transformation looks like — eliminating the biggest barrier to requesting a quote. Specific product selection and blade-type consultation happen during your normal sales process, where your expertise shines.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will it work for front yards, backyards, and side yards?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Homeowners can upload photos of any outdoor space — front lawn, backyard, side strip, pet area, or even rooftop decks. The visualization adapts to the specific space in the photo and generates a realistic turf preview for that area.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is Vizzion different from turf manufacturer sample programs?",
      answer:
        "Turf samples show a homeowner what the product feels like in their hand — but samples can't show what turf will look like across their actual yard, with their specific landscaping, shade patterns, and hardscape. Vizzion bridges that gap with a photo-realistic digital preview of their entire yard transformed. Samples and Vizzion work well together: the preview gets them excited, the sample seals the tactile experience.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the widget to match my company branding?",
      answer:
        `Fully. You set your turf company's logo, brand colors, and custom button text — something like "See Turf on Your Lawn" or "Preview Your Yard." The widget looks like a built-in feature of your site, not a third-party tool. Homeowners interact with your brand the entire time, which matters when they're choosing between you and three other installers in their area.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Does Vizzion integrate with my CRM or scheduling software?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Vizzion connects directly with Jobber, Housecall Pro, Service Autopilot, and LMN — the tools turf and landscaping companies actually run on. It also integrates with HubSpot, Salesforce, and anything that accepts webhooks or Zapier triggers. Leads arrive with contact info, yard photo, and engagement data, ready to auto-route into your estimate scheduling workflow.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are the leads exclusive to my company?",
      answer:
        "100% exclusive. Every lead comes from your own website — not a marketplace that sells the same homeowner to 3 to 5 competing turf installers in drought-heavy markets like Phoenix or Las Vegas. No bidding wars, no speed-to-lead races. The homeowner saw turf on their yard through your site and gave you their info directly.",
