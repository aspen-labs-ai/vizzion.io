      "The $20 Billion Window Problem: Homeowners Can't Buy What They Can't See",
    paragraphs: [
      `The U.S. window and door replacement market exceeds $20 billion annually, driven by aging housing stock, energy efficiency mandates, and a homeowner base that increasingly treats curb appeal as a financial investment. But here's the disconnect that window and door companies deal with every day: a homeowner walks into a showroom, stares at thirty window samples mounted on a display wall, and still has no idea what those windows will look like on their 1987 split-level. The showroom experience is fundamentally broken for this category. Unlike paint — where you can hold a swatch up to a wall — windows and doors reshape the entire facade of a home. Frame color alone (black, white, bronze, natural wood, dark cherry) changes the character of a house completely. Add in grid pattern variations — colonial, prairie, craftsman, no grids — and you're looking at hundreds of possible combinations that a homeowner cannot evaluate from a 12-inch sample in a fluorescent-lit warehouse.`,

      `The numbers bear this out. Average whole-house window replacement runs $8,000 to $25,000 depending on material and style, with individual windows costing $400 to $1,200 installed. Entry doors range from $1,500 to $5,000 for quality fiberglass or steel with sidelights. At these price points, homeowners are not impulse buyers. They research for three to six months, visit multiple showrooms, request in-home consultations, and frequently delay the purchase because they're paralyzed by choice. A Pella dealer in the Midwest told us their average sales cycle is 97 days from first contact to signed contract — and nearly a third of their qualified leads go cold before ever making a decision. The culprit isn't price sensitivity or competition. It's visualization paralysis. The homeowner genuinely cannot picture what black double-hung windows with prairie grids will do to their white colonial versus their neighbor's craftsman-style home. So they wait. And wait. And eventually, they either go with the cheapest option or do nothing at all.`,

      `Meanwhile, the major manufacturers — Andersen, Pella, Marvin, Milgard — have invested millions in online configurators and design tools. But these tools all share the same limitation: they show generic house renderings or require the homeowner to build a model from scratch. Pella's visualizer uses a library of stock home styles. Andersen's Design Tool lets you configure a window in isolation. Marvin's tool focuses on product specs. None of them answer the only question the homeowner actually cares about: "What will this look like on MY house?" That gap between showroom samples and the homeowner's actual facade is where deals die. Window companies lose qualified prospects not because their product is wrong, but because the homeowner couldn't bridge the imagination gap before the quote expired or a competitor's salesperson showed up with a better rendering. Your website visitors — the ones browsing frame colors at 10 PM on a Tuesday — are the highest-intent prospects in your funnel. They've already decided they need new windows. They just need to see it on their home to pull the trigger. And right now, your website gives them a spec sheet and a "Request a Quote" form. That's the gap Vizzion fills.`,
