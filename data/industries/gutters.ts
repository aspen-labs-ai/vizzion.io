      "Gutter Companies Are Competing on Price — Because Nothing Else Differentiates Them",
    paragraphs: [
      `The U.S. gutter market generates over $7 billion annually, yet individual gutter companies operate in one of the most commoditized corners of home improvement. Seamless aluminum gutters account for roughly 80% of all residential installations, and from the homeowner's perspective, one contractor's 5-inch K-style looks identical to another's. When the product feels interchangeable, the only differentiator becomes price — and that's a race to the bottom that erodes margins for everyone. The average gutter installation runs $1,000 to $3,500, leaving slim room for marketing spend when you're already quoting against two or three competitors on every job.`,
      `Here's what most gutter contractors miss: the visual decision is the untapped leverage point. Major manufacturers like Alcoa, Senox, and Spectra offer 25 to 30+ color options across multiple profiles — K-style, half-round, box, and fascia gutters. Homeowners have real choices to make about how their gutters coordinate with their roof, fascia board, trim, and siding. But that decision almost never happens on your website. Instead, it happens in the driveway with a fanned-out set of color chips that all look the same in direct sunlight, or worse, the homeowner just says "white" because they can't visualize anything else. That default kills upsell opportunities on premium colors, copper accents, and decorative half-round profiles that carry significantly higher margins.`,
      `The lead generation landscape makes this worse. Most gutter companies rely on the same playbook: Angi and HomeAdvisor leads at $25 to $60 per pop, shared with three to five other contractors who all call within the first hour. Close rates on those shared leads hover around 10 to 15% — meaning you're spending $250 to $600 in lead costs to land a single $2,000 job. Meanwhile, your own website — the one place where a homeowner has already chosen your company — converts at 2 to 3% with a basic contact form. Storm damage and insurance claims drive over 30% of gutter replacements, sending surges of urgent traffic to local gutter websites. Those homeowners are ready to act, but your static site gives them nothing to engage with. They fill out a form, or more likely, they bounce to the next result on Google.`,

Consider what you're spending now: shared leads from Angi or HomeAdvisor run $25 to $60 each, and close rates on those leads average 10 to 15%.

        "Can homeowners actually see different gutter profiles and colors on their home?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Homeowners upload a photo of their house and the widget shows realistic previews of different gutter options — K-style, half-round, box gutters — in a full range of colors from major manufacturers. They can compare white vs. dark bronze vs. copper on their actual roofline, not on a stock photo of someone else's house.",

      answer:
        "Absolutely. You can configure the widget to include gutter guard options alongside standard gutter previews. When homeowners see gutter guards installed on their home during the visualization, it plants the seed for a higher-value project. Gutter guard add-ons typically run $1,500 to $4,000, so even a small increase in attachment rate moves the needle significantly.",

We also support webhooks and Zapier, so you can push leads into ServiceTitan, Jobber, AccuLynx, or any other tool in your stack. Each lead includes the homeowner's email, home photo, selected gutter style, and engagement data.",

      question: "Will this help during storm damage season?",
      answer:
        "Storm damage is where Vizzion shines for gutter companies. After a hailstorm or severe weather event, local search traffic spikes hard — homeowners are searching for gutter repair and replacement right now. A static contact form wastes that surge. Vizzion gives those urgent visitors an immediate, engaging action: upload a photo, see new gutters, and submit their info. You capture leads while competitors are still waiting for phone calls.",

      question: "Can I customize the widget to match my company branding?",
      answer:
        'Fully white-label. Match your gutter company\'s colors and logo, set custom CTA text like "Preview Gutters on Your Home" or "See Your New Gutters," and control the messaging end to end. Homeowners experience it as a built-in feature of your website, not a third-party tool.',

      question: "What kind of photos do homeowners need to upload?",
      answer:
        "Any clear photo showing their roofline works — a phone snapshot from the street, a Google Street View screenshot, or even a photo taken from across the yard. The image needs to show enough of the roofline and fascia for the widget to generate an accurate preview. If the photo is too blurry or cropped too tightly, the widget prompts the homeowner to try again with a clearer image.",
