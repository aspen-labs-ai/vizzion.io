Gutters are a grudge purchase — homeowners don't care until water is pouring over the fascia. When they finally search, they grab three quotes and pick the lowest number. Vizzion breaks that pattern. Visitors upload a photo of their home, preview gutter profiles and colors on their actual roofline, and enter their email to keep the result. You get an exclusive lead who already knows what they want. They get a reason to choose you over the cheapest guy on page one.",

      "The Gutter Business Has a Differentiation Problem — and It's Costing You Margin",
    paragraphs: [
      `The residential gutter industry does over $7 billion in annual revenue, but for individual contractors the math is brutal. Seamless aluminum K-style dominates roughly 80% of installations, every competitor runs the same truck-mounted machine, and the finished product is nearly invisible from the street. When homeowners can't tell one gutter job from another, they default to the only variable they understand: price. Your $2,800 quote loses to the $2,200 one, even when your gauge, hangers, and warranty are demonstrably better. The average residential gutter job lands between $1,000 and $3,500, and after material, labor, and overhead, that razor-thin margin leaves almost nothing for customer acquisition. Most gutter contractors spend less than 3% of revenue on marketing — not because they don't want to grow, but because there's no room.`,
      `The irony is that homeowners actually have more choices than they realize. Senox, Spectra, Berger, and Alcoa offer 25 to 32 colors across K-style, half-round, box, and fascia profiles. Copper and zinc options carry two to four times the margin of standard aluminum. But none of those options matter if the homeowner never sees them. The typical sales process plays out in the driveway: a technician fans out a ring of tiny color chips, the homeowner squints at them in direct sunlight where every shade looks identical, and says "just match the trim" or "white is fine." That default costs gutter contractors thousands in lost upsell revenue on every job. Premium color and profile upgrades can add $800 to $2,500 to a standard installation — money that evaporates when the selection process is a thirty-second afterthought.`,
      `Lead generation compounds the problem. The Angi and HomeAdvisor playbook delivers leads at $25 to $60 each, but those leads are shared with three to five competitors. Close rates on shared gutter leads typically run 12 to 18%, which means you're spending $200 to $500 in lead cost alone to land one job. Storm seasons — hail, ice dams, heavy downpours — drive over 30% of all gutter replacements and send surges of urgent traffic to local search results. Those homeowners are ready to buy today, but your website offers them a static contact form and a stock photo of seamless gutters on someone else's house. Most of them bounce within 15 seconds. They don't fill out the form, don't call, and don't come back. They just move to the next result. Your own website — the only channel where a homeowner has already chosen your brand — converts at 2 to 4% while the other 96% vanish without a trace.`,

Context matters: shared gutter leads from Angi and HomeAdvisor cost $25 to $60 each and close at 12 to 18% — meaning you spend $180 to $450 in lead cost per closed job.

When homeowners see leaf protection installed on their home during the visualization, they arrive at the estimate already interested in the upgrade — not hearing about it for the first time. Gutter guard add-ons run $1,500 to $4,500, so even a modest increase in attachment rate adds significant revenue per job.",
