    paragraphs: [
      `The marine decking industry has a visualization problem that nobody talks about. A boat owner notices their deck is fading, the non-skid is peeling, or the original carpet is holding mildew. They start researching options — SeaDek, Castaway Customs, Marine Mat, synthetic teak planking, closed-cell EVA foam — and they land on your website. They browse your gallery, maybe flip through a few stock photos of perfect center-console installs. But none of those boats look like theirs. They have a 2019 Mako 214 CC, not a 42-foot Yellowfin. So they bounce. Maybe they request a sample kit. Maybe they don't. Either way, you just lost a $4,000 to $8,000 re-deck job to indecision.`,
      `The sample kit problem is real and expensive. Marine decking companies ship thousands of material swatches every year — color chips, foam squares, texture samples — and the conversion rate is brutal. Most sample kits cost $15 to $30 to assemble and ship, and fewer than 10% of recipients ever convert to a paid job. Boat owners hold the samples up against their helm pad, squint, try to imagine how "Storm Gray" would look across their entire swim platform and cockpit sole, and give up. The mental leap from a 4-inch swatch to a fully installed deck is too far. Samples tell you what the material feels like. They don't show you what your boat will look like.`,
      `Meanwhile, your website does almost nothing to bridge that gap. Most marine dealer and decking installer sites are glorified portfolios — photo galleries of past jobs, a list of brands carried, maybe a contact form. The conversion rate on these sites hovers around 1 to 3 percent. Boat shows help fill the pipeline during season, but that leaves eight months of the year where your website is your primary storefront and it converts worse than a business card. Every marine decking company knows they need better web presence. None of them have a tool that actually engages visitors and converts curiosity into a real quote request.`,

      question: "What types of boats and decking materials does Vizzion support?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion works with any boat type — center consoles, bay boats, pontoons, sport fishers, cruisers, ski boats, and personal watercraft. It supports all major decking materials including SeaDek, Marine Mat, Castaway Customs, synthetic teak planking, closed-cell EVA foam, marine vinyl, and traditional teak. If you install it, Vizzion can visualize it.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to set up Vizzion on my website?",
      answer:
        `Under five minutes. Copy a single embed snippet, paste it into any page on your site — homepage, decking services page, or a dedicated "Visualize Your New Deck" landing page. The widget matches your brand styling automatically. No developer or IT team required.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Will this replace our sample kit program?",
      answer:
        `It won't replace physical samples entirely — some boat owners will always want to touch the material. But Vizzion dramatically reduces the volume of speculative sample requests. Owners who visualize their boat with new decking first are far more likely to convert when they do request a sample, because they've already committed mentally. Most of our marine clients see sample kit fulfillment costs drop 40-60% while their close rate on remaining sample requests goes up.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Does Vizzion work with my existing website and CMS?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Vizzion is a lightweight JavaScript widget that works on any website — WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, custom-built, or any platform that supports HTML embed codes. If your web provider lets you paste a snippet of code, you can run Vizzion.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does Vizzion help during the off-season when boat shows aren't running?",
      answer:
        `That's exactly when Vizzion delivers the most value. Boat owners research upgrades year-round — especially during fall and winter when their boat is in storage and they're planning spring projects. Your website is your only storefront during those eight months. Vizzion turns it from a static gallery into an interactive experience that captures leads and fills your spring installation pipeline before the season even starts.`,
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of photo does the boat owner need to upload?",
      answer:
        "Any clear photo of their deck surface works — a phone photo taken at the dock, a shot from a fishing trip, even a photo taken in the driveway on a trailer. The system handles a wide range of angles and lighting conditions. For best results, a straight-on shot of the deck area they want to upgrade gives the most realistic preview.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are the leads exclusive to my business?",
      answer:
        "Yes — 100% exclusive. Every lead generated through Vizzion comes from your own website traffic and belongs solely to you. No shared lists, no lead brokers, no competing with other shops for the same boat owner. They engaged with your brand, on your site, and gave you their information directly.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does Vizzion integrate with my CRM or quoting software?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion supports direct integrations with popular CRMs including HubSpot, Salesforce, and Jobber. We also support webhooks and Zapier, which means leads can route into virtually any system you already use — including marine-specific platforms. Each lead arrives with the owner's contact info, original deck photo, and the visualization they viewed.",
