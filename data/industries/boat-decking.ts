    paragraphs: [
      `Marine decking has a visualization problem. A boat owner's deck is fading, the non-skid is shot, or the original carpet reeks of mildew. They Google options — SeaDek, Castaway Customs, Marine Mat, synthetic teak — and land on your site. They browse your gallery, but none of those boats look like theirs. They've got a 2019 Mako 214 CC, not a 42-foot Yellowfin. So they bounce, and you just lost a $1,500 to $6,000 re-deck job to indecision.`,
      `Then there's the sample kit drain. You're spending $15 to $30 per kit — foam swatches, color chips, shipping — and fewer than 1 in 10 recipients ever convert. Owners hold a 4-inch square up to their helm pad and try to imagine "Storm Gray" across an entire cockpit sole. They can't. Samples show texture. They don't show what the finished boat looks like.`,
      `Your website isn't helping either. Most decking installer sites are glorified portfolios — past-job galleries, brand logos, a contact form. They convert at 1 to 3 percent. Boat shows fill the pipeline during season, but up to 60% of marine sales happen in those few show weekends, leaving eight months where your site is the storefront and it's basically a brochure.`,

  faq: [
    {
      question: "What types of boats and decking materials does Vizzion support?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion works with any boat type — center consoles, bay boats, pontoons, sport fishers, cruisers, ski boats, and personal watercraft. It supports all major decking materials including SeaDek, Marine Mat, Castaway Customs, synthetic teak planking, closed-cell EVA foam, marine vinyl, and traditional teak. If you install it, Vizzion can visualize it.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to set up Vizzion on my website?",
      answer:
        `Under five minutes. You copy one embed snippet and paste it on your decking services page, or create a dedicated "Visualize Your New Deck" page that captures leads year-round — even during the off-season when boat shows aren't running. The widget auto-matches your site's branding. No developer needed.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Will this replace our sample kit program?",
      answer:
        `It won't replace physical samples entirely — some boat owners will always want to touch the material. But Vizzion dramatically reduces the volume of speculative sample requests. Owners who visualize their boat with new decking first are far more likely to convert when they do request a sample, because they've already committed mentally. Most of our marine clients see sample kit fulfillment costs drop 40-60% while their close rate on remaining sample requests goes up.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Does Vizzion work with my existing website and CMS?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Most marine decking shops run WordPress or Squarespace, and Vizzion works on both — along with Wix, custom-built sites, and any platform that supports HTML embeds. It sits right alongside your existing boat photo galleries and install portfolios without disrupting anything.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does Vizzion help during the off-season when boat shows aren't running?",
      answer:
        `That's exactly when Vizzion delivers the most value. Boat owners research upgrades year-round — especially during fall and winter when their boat is in storage and they're planning spring projects. Your website is your only storefront during those eight months. Vizzion turns it from a static gallery into an interactive experience that captures leads and fills your spring installation pipeline before the season even starts.`,
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of photo does the boat owner need to upload?",
      answer:
        "Any clear photo of their deck surface works — a phone photo taken at the dock, a shot from a fishing trip, even a photo taken in the driveway on a trailer. The system handles a wide range of angles and lighting conditions. For best results, a straight-on shot of the deck area they want to upgrade gives the most realistic preview.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are the leads exclusive to my business?",
      answer:
        "100% exclusive. Unlike boat show leads that get passed around and go cold within two weeks, or sample kit requests where 90% never convert, every Vizzion lead comes from your own website and belongs solely to you. The boat owner engaged with your brand, visualized decking on their boat, and handed you their contact info directly.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does Vizzion integrate with my CRM or quoting software?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion pushes leads directly into HubSpot, Salesforce, Jobber, or any system you use via webhooks and Zapier. Each lead includes the boat owner's contact info, their original deck photo, and the material they chose — so your quoting workflow starts with a clear picture of the job instead of a vague phone inquiry. That context cuts your estimate turnaround dramatically.",
