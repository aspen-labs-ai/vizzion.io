      "Roofing Leads Cost Too Much and Close Too Slow — Here's Why",
    paragraphs: [
      `The U.S. roofing market generates over $60 billion in annual revenue, with more than 5 million roofs replaced every year. Yet most roofing contractors are stuck in the same lead generation hamster wheel: buying shared leads from Angi, HomeAdvisor, or Modernize at $40 to $120 per lead, then racing four other contractors to be the first callback. The industry-wide close rate on bought leads hovers around 15 to 20 percent for retail roofing, and closer to 25 percent for storm restoration work where urgency does the selling for you. That means for every five leads you buy, you're closing one — maybe — and paying $200 to $600 in lead costs alone before you factor in sales rep time, truck rolls for estimates, and the drone flights or ladder climbs needed to measure the roof.`,

      `The deeper problem is the visualization gap. A roof is the single largest visible surface on any home, and the average replacement costs $8,000 to $15,000 for asphalt shingles — north of $25,000 for metal or tile. Homeowners are staring at a decision that will define what their house looks like for the next 20 to 50 years, and the best the industry gives them is a 3×5 inch shingle sample or a manufacturer's stock photo of a model home in a subdivision that looks nothing like theirs. The disconnect between a palm-sized sample and a 2,000-square-foot roof is enormous. Shingle colors shift dramatically at scale — a sample that looks charcoal on a kitchen counter can read almost black across an entire roofline. Metal panels that appear subtle in a brochure can dominate a home's curb appeal. Homeowners know this instinctively, which is why they hesitate, delay, and ghost.`,

      `Meanwhile, the tools roofing contractors actually use — EagleView for aerial measurements, Roofr for instant estimates, GAF QuickMeasure for material calculations, and CompanyCam for project documentation — all activate after you already have the lead. They're essential for production and proposal generation, but they do nothing to capture the homeowner in the first place. Roofr's Instant Estimator comes closest to top-of-funnel engagement by letting homeowners get a ballpark price on a contractor's website, but it solves for price transparency, not visual confidence. A homeowner who knows a roof costs $12,000 but can't picture how Weathered Wood architectural shingles will look on their specific Cape Cod is still not ready to commit. The funnel has a hole at the very top — between the moment a homeowner searches "roofing contractor near me" and the moment they hand over their phone number. That's the gap where you lose 95 percent of your website visitors, and it's exactly what Vizzion fills.`,

        "How long does it take to add Vizzion to my roofing website?",

        "Under five minutes. You copy one embed snippet and paste it onto any page — your homepage, a service area page, or a dedicated 'See Your New Roof' landing page. No developer needed. Works with WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, and custom-built sites. The widget starts generating leads the moment you publish.",

    {
      question: "Can homeowners compare different roofing materials and colors?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Homeowners can preview multiple options on their actual home — asphalt architectural shingles, standing seam metal, clay tile, synthetic slate, and more. They can switch between colors and styles to see how each looks on their specific roofline. This comparison ability is what drives material upgrades — when they see designer shingles next to standard 3-tab on their own roof, the premium sells itself.",

      question: "Does Vizzion work for storm restoration leads, not just retail?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Storm restoration has a different sales motion — urgency is high but homeowners are overwhelmed with choices. Embed Vizzion on a storm-specific landing page or pair it with door-knocking follow-ups. After a hailstorm, run targeted ads to a page where homeowners upload a photo and see what their new roof looks like. They get peace of mind about the end result, you get a qualified lead with their home photo and material preference. Several of our roofing customers use Vizzion specifically for storm season lead capture.",

      question: "How is Vizzion different from Roofr or EagleView?",
      answer:
        "Roofr's Instant Estimator gives homeowners a ballpark price — great for price transparency, but it doesn't show them what the roof will look like. EagleView and GAF QuickMeasure provide aerial measurements for your production team — essential tools, but they're post-lead. Vizzion works at the top of the funnel: it shows homeowners a realistic preview of roofing materials on their actual home and captures their email. It's complementary to Roofr and EagleView, not competing. Use Vizzion to capture the lead, then use your measurement and estimating tools to close the deal.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does Vizzion cost compared to buying roofing leads?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion has a free tier to test the product, with scaled plans based on monthly visualization volume. Compare it to your current lead costs: shared roofing leads from Angi or HomeAdvisor run $40 to $120 each, and you're splitting them with three to five competitors. A single closed roof at $10,000 to $15,000 covers months of Vizzion. Most roofing contractors see positive ROI within the first two weeks — the math is straightforward when your leads are exclusive and free of per-lead fees.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does it integrate with my roofing CRM?",
      answer:
        "Direct integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, JobNimbus, and AccuLynx — the CRMs roofing contractors actually use. We also support webhooks and Zapier for connecting to Jobber, ServiceTitan, CompanyCam, and any other tools in your stack. Each lead arrives with the homeowner's email, roof photo, and the specific material they previewed.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if homeowners upload a bad photo or the roof is partially hidden by trees?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion handles a wide range of image quality — phone photos from the street, Google Maps screenshots, even slightly angled shots with partial tree coverage. The system identifies the roofline and generates a realistic preview. For images where the roof is completely obscured or extremely low-resolution, the widget prompts the homeowner to try a clearer photo. In practice, most homeowners take a quick phone photo from their front yard and it works perfectly.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I white-label the widget to match my roofing company's brand?",
      answer:
        "Fully white-label. Match your company colors, add your logo, and customize CTA text to say something like 'See Your New Roof' or 'Preview Shingle Colors on Your Home.' Homeowners experience it as a built-in feature of your website, not a third-party tool. Your brand stays front and center throughout the entire experience.",
