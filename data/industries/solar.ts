    headline: "Solar Lead Gen Is Broken — And Everyone Knows It",
    paragraphs: [
      `The math hasn't worked for years. You're paying $50 to $150 per lead from aggregators like EnergySage, Modernize, or Google LSA — and those leads are shared with three to five other companies the moment they hit your inbox. Speed to lead becomes a foot race where the first callback wins, regardless of who's actually the better company. Your sales team burns hours chasing contacts who already signed with someone else, and your cost per acquisition climbs toward $4,000 or more per closed deal. Meanwhile, your own website — the one asset you fully control — converts at roughly 2 to 3 percent. The other 97% of visitors browse your testimonials, maybe check your service area, then leave without a trace.`,
      `The core problem isn't traffic. Most established solar companies get decent organic or paid traffic. The problem is what happens between a homeowner landing on your site and actually filling out a contact form. There's a gap — an uncertainty gap. Homeowners are curious about solar, but they can't picture what panels would look like on their specific roof. They've seen generic stock photos of perfect California ranch homes with flush-mount arrays, and that looks nothing like their two-story colonial in New Jersey. Without a way to see it on their own home, the mental leap from \"interested\" to \"ready to talk to a sales rep\" is too far. So they bounce. They might come back in six months. They might not.`,
      `Every major design tool in solar — Aurora Solar, OpenSolar, Solargraf — activates after you already have the lead. Those platforms are built for proposal generation, system design, and post-sale engineering. They're essential tools, but they do nothing to help you capture the lead in the first place. There's a massive blind spot in the solar sales funnel: the top. The moment between a homeowner's first spark of interest and their decision to hand over contact information. That's the gap Vizzion was built to fill.`,

      `Vizzion is a lightweight, embeddable widget that turns your website into an interactive solar preview experience. A homeowner uploads a photo of their roof — from their phone, a screenshot from Google Maps, whatever they have — and within seconds they see a photo-realistic rendering of solar panels on their actual home. Not a generic mockup. Their home, their roof, their panels. To see the full result, they enter their email. That's it. You now have an exclusive lead who has already visualized going solar, generated entirely from your own web traffic at zero marginal cost.`,

        `Aurora Solar, OpenSolar, and Solargraf are post-lead tools — they help you design systems, generate proposals, and close deals after you already have a lead in your pipeline. Vizzion works at the top of the funnel, on your public website, to capture that lead in the first place. They're complementary, not competing. Use Vizzion to generate the lead, then use Aurora or OpenSolar to design the system and close the sale.`,
    },
    {
      question: "What if a homeowner uploads a low-quality or unclear photo?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion is designed to work with a wide range of image quality — phone photos, Google Maps screenshots, and even slightly angled shots. The system identifies the rooftop area and generates a realistic preview regardless. For extremely low-resolution or obstructed images, the widget prompts the homeowner to try a clearer photo, keeping the experience smooth.",

    {
      question: "Can I customize the widget to match my company branding?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Vizzion is fully white-label. You control the colors, logo, button text, and messaging. Homeowners interact with what looks and feels like a native feature of your website. Your brand stays front and center throughout the entire experience.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are the leads exclusive to my company?",
      answer:
        "Yes — 100% exclusive. Unlike bought leads from aggregators that are sold to multiple companies simultaneously, every lead generated through Vizzion comes from your own website traffic and belongs solely to you. No sharing, no bidding, no competition. The homeowner engaged with your brand, on your site, and gave you their information directly.",
