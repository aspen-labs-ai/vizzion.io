      "Most installers still rely on shared lead marketplaces. You pay for contacts that multiple competitors receive, then your team races to call first. That model rewards speed over fit, compresses margin, and keeps your pipeline dependent on outside vendors instead of your own website. You end up buying lead volume you cannot control while your team chases response time instead of quality conversations.",
      "Your site still attracts interested homeowners, but many hesitate because they cannot picture panels on their specific roof. Proposal tools like Aurora and OpenSolar help after a lead exists, not before. Vizzion fills that top-of-funnel gap by turning curiosity into a visual experience and capturing contact info at the point of intent. This helps convert motivation earlier, before visitors drift into endless comparison shopping. Fewer high-intent visitors disappear before your team can engage.",

        "Usually under five minutes. Paste one embed snippet on your homepage or landing page, then publish. It is built for non-technical teams and works with WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, and custom websites.",

    {
      question: "How much does Vizzion cost?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion includes a free tier and paid plans based on monthly visualization volume. Compared with shared leads, one closed residential solar deal can cover months of software cost while self-generated leads improve margin and forecasting.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Vizzion work with my existing website and CMS?",
      answer:
        "Yes. If your website supports an HTML embed, Vizzion can run on it. Most teams place it on high-intent pages tied to SEO or paid traffic so homeowners can preview panels before requesting consultation.",

      question: "How does Vizzion integrate with my CRM?",
      answer:
        "Leads can route into Salesforce, HubSpot, Enerflo, JobNimbus, or other systems through webhooks and Zapier. Each submission can include contact details, roof image, and engagement context so reps can prioritize and personalize follow-up.",

    {
      question: "How is Vizzion different from Aurora Solar or OpenSolar?",
      answer:
        "Aurora Solar, OpenSolar, and Solargraf are post-lead tools used after a prospect is in your pipeline. Vizzion works earlier on your public website to capture and qualify that prospect first, so the tools are complementary.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are the leads exclusive to my company?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Vizzion leads come from your own website visitors and are not shared with other installers. The homeowner interacted with your brand, used your preview experience, and submitted details directly to your team for follow-up.",
