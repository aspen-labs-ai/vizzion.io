      `Tattoos are permanent. That's the entire appeal — and the entire obstacle. Clients hesitate, reschedule, cancel, and no-show because they can't be sure how a design will actually look on their body. Vizzion lets them upload a photo of their arm, back, leg, or anywhere — and see the tattoo design on their actual skin in seconds. They enter their email to save the preview. You get a committed lead who's already past the fear of regret.`,

    paragraphs: [
      `Every tattoo artist knows the pattern. A client comes in for a consultation, loves the design on paper or on an iPad screen, books the appointment — and then cancels two days before. Or worse, just doesn't show up. No call, no text. The chair sits empty for three hours that could have been booked. The reason is almost always the same: they got cold feet. Not because they didn't like the design. Because they couldn't fully picture what it would look like on their body, in that specific placement, at that specific size. Paper stencils and iPad sketches help, but they don't close the gap between "I like this design" and "I'm ready to have this on my skin forever." That gap is where cancellations live.`,
      `The economics are brutal. The average tattoo studio in the U.S. operates with 15 to 30% no-show and late-cancellation rates. For a studio billing $150 to $200 per hour, a single no-show on a three-hour session is $450 to $600 in lost revenue — with zero notice and no way to fill the slot. Multiply that across a week and you're looking at thousands in unrealized income. Deposits help recoup some of it, but they don't solve the underlying problem: clients who aren't fully committed because they can't fully visualize the outcome. Studios have tried everything — non-refundable deposits, cancellation fees, waiting lists, even temporary tattoo prints. None of these address the root cause, which is uncertainty about how the final piece will look on their specific body.`,
      `Meanwhile, your website and social media feed are doing the same thing every other studio does: showing photos of completed work on other people. A client sees a stunning sleeve on someone else's arm and thinks, "That looks incredible — but would it look like that on me?" Your portfolio proves you're talented. It doesn't prove that this specific design will work on this specific person's body. That's a completely different kind of confidence, and it's the one that actually drives bookings. InkHunter tried to solve this as a standalone app years ago, but it was consumer-facing and never gave studios an embeddable tool for their own website. Vizzion fills that gap — putting the visualization experience on your site, under your brand, capturing leads for your studio.`,

      question: "How long does it take to set up Vizzion on my studio website?",
      answer:
        `Under five minutes. You copy one embed snippet and paste it on any page of your site — WordPress, Squarespace, Wix, or custom-built. No developer or tech skills needed. The widget adapts to your site's design and starts capturing leads immediately.`,

      question: "Can I upload my own tattoo designs and flash sheets?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. You upload your own designs — flash sheets, custom pieces, signature styles, or style category samples. Clients only see your work, and the widget acts as an interactive extension of your portfolio. You control exactly what designs are available for preview.",
    },
    {
      question: "How realistic are the tattoo previews?",
      answer:
        "The previews are photo-realistic digital renderings that account for skin contours, body curvature, and natural shading. They give clients a strong, accurate sense of how the design will look at their chosen size and placement. While no digital preview can perfectly replicate ink on skin, the visualization is accurate enough to resolve placement, scale, and style questions — the exact concerns that cause cancellations.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does the client need to download an app?",
      answer:
        "No. Vizzion runs entirely in the web browser — no app download, no account creation, no friction. The client visits your website, taps the widget, uploads a photo, and sees the preview. It works on any modern smartphone or computer.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from InkHunter or other tattoo preview apps?",
      answer:
        `InkHunter and similar apps are consumer-facing tools — they let users try generic designs from a public library. Vizzion is a business tool built for your studio. It lives on your website, showcases your designs, captures leads with email addresses, and feeds them into your booking system. The client interacts with your brand, not a third-party app. And you own the lead.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Does Vizzion work with my booking software?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Vizzion integrates with Square Appointments, Vagaro, Acuity Scheduling, Tattoodo Pro, and any platform that supports Zapier or webhooks. Leads arrive with the client's contact info, their chosen design, the body photo, and the preview — everything you need to follow up and book the session.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does Vizzion cost?",
      answer:
        `Vizzion offers tiered pricing based on visualization volume. There's a free tier for studios to test the product, and scaled plans for higher-traffic shops. Since every lead comes from traffic you're already getting, most studios see a positive ROI within days. Contact us for current pricing details.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Can clients try different placements and sizes?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Clients can adjust the position and scale of the design on their body photo, trying different placements before settling on the one they love. This is one of the most powerful features for reducing post-booking anxiety — clients arrive at their session confident about exactly where and how big the tattoo will be.",
