      "Siding Sales Are Stuck in the Swatch-and-Hope Era",
    paragraphs: [
      `The US siding market generates over $12 billion in annual revenue, yet the way siding companies sell hasn't fundamentally changed in decades. A homeowner calls or fills out a form. A rep drives out with a suitcase full of 3-by-5-inch color samples. They hold swatches against the house, squint, try to imagine what 2,400 square feet of "Aged Pewter" would look like versus "Iron Gray." The homeowner says they need to think about it. And then you wait — days, weeks, sometimes months — for a decision on a project that averages $8,000 to $20,000 depending on material.`,
      `The core problem is visualization at scale. Siding is one of the most visually transformative home improvements — swap vinyl for fiber cement board-and-batten and the same house looks like it gained $80,000 in curb appeal. But homeowners can't see that transformation until it's already installed. Small swatches don't convey how a color reads across an entire facade. They don't show how horizontal lap siding compares to vertical board-and-batten on the same gable. They certainly don't reveal how James Hardie's "Evening Blue" plays against existing stone veneer and a charcoal roof. So homeowners stall. They request a third appointment. They collect more swatches. They search Pinterest for houses that "kind of look like mine." And every week they delay, there's a chance they cool off entirely or call your competitor.`,
      `Material choice compounds the indecision. The siding market is split between vinyl (still the most installed by volume), fiber cement (James Hardie alone commands roughly 35% of the cladding market by revenue), engineered wood (LP SmartSide growing at double-digit rates), and premium options like natural cedar and stone veneer. Each material has a different texture, shadow profile, and color palette. A homeowner comparing vinyl Dutch lap to Hardie plank to LP SmartSide isn't just choosing a color — they're choosing a completely different aesthetic for their home's exterior. That level of complexity demands more than swatches pinned to a clipboard. It demands seeing each option on their actual house, at full scale, before they write a check.`,
      `Storm damage restoration adds urgency but not clarity. After a hailstorm or hurricane, insurance adjusters approve siding replacements and homeowners face a fast decision: pick a material, pick a color, sign a contract. Restoration contractors who can show a homeowner exactly what their rebuilt exterior will look like — in their driveway, on their phone, within minutes of the initial inspection — close faster and at higher margins than those who hand over a brochure. In markets like Texas, the Midwest, and the Southeast, storm-driven siding replacements account for a significant share of annual installations. Speed of visualization directly translates to speed of close.`,
      `Meanwhile, the digital gap keeps widening. National brands like James Hardie offer their own color visualizer tools, but those live on the manufacturer's website — driving traffic away from your company. Third-party lead platforms share leads across multiple contractors in the same ZIP code, replicating the same race-to-the-phone problem solar installers know all too well. Your own website, where the homeowner already found you and trusts your brand, converts at maybe 2 to 4 percent. The other 96% browse your gallery of other people's houses, check your service area, and leave without identifying themselves. That's the gap Vizzion closes: the moment between "I'm curious about new siding" and "here's my email, show me what it looks like on my house."`,

Compare that to third-party siding leads at $60 to $120 each — shared with multiple contractors in your area. One closed siding project at $12,000 to $20,000 pays for Vizzion many times over. Most siding companies see positive ROI within the first two weeks.",

      question: "Can I customize the widget to show only the siding brands I carry?",
      answer:
        "Fully customizable. Show only the materials and colors you actually install — if you're a certified James Hardie contractor, feature Hardie's full color palette. If you specialize in LP SmartSide or vinyl, curate accordingly. You control the options homeowners see, so every visualization aligns with what you can actually deliver.",
