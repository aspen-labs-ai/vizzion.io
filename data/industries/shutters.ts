      "Shutter Sales Stall Because Homeowners Can't See What They're Buying",
    paragraphs: [
      `The U.S. exterior shutters market exceeds $3 billion annually, and the math behind each job is straightforward: a full-home shutter installation runs $1,500 to $5,000 depending on material, style, and window count. Vinyl sits at the entry level around $150 to $350 per pair. Composite and engineered wood push into the $300 to $600 range. Premium hardwood — eastern red cedar, mahogany, Spanish cedar — starts at $500 per pair and climbs from there. Aluminum hurricane shutters command $700 or more in coastal markets. For a typical four-bedroom home with ten to fourteen windows, that's a $2,000 to $7,000 decision. Homeowners don't impulse-buy at that price point, and your competitors know it — which is why every shutter company is fighting for the same pool of hesitant prospects.`,

      `The core problem is that shutters are a purely aesthetic purchase, yet the industry offers homeowners almost nothing to help them visualize the outcome. A homeowner staring at their split-level ranch is trying to decide between raised panel shutters in black, louvered shutters in hunter green, or board-and-batten shutters in iron gray. Each option would give their house a completely different personality — colonial elegance, coastal charm, or modern farmhouse. But all they have is a four-inch color swatch, a portfolio page of houses that look nothing like theirs, and maybe a generic "design your shutters" tool that renders options on a stock Colonial that bears no resemblance to their actual home. The gap between interest and commitment is where your sales pipeline bleeds out.`,

      `And the complexity doesn't stop at style. Shutters exist in a visual ecosystem with siding, trim, front door, roofline, and landscaping. A homeowner with Sherwin-Williams Agreeable Gray siding and a burgundy front door faces entirely different shutter options than someone with James Hardie Arctic White and a navy door. Hardware — decorative hinges, shutter dogs, holdbacks, pintles — adds another dimension of visual customization that catalogs can't convey. Then there's compliance: in historical districts from Charleston to Georgetown, and in HOA communities from coast to coast, specific shutter styles, proportions, and even mounting methods are mandated. A homeowner who guesses wrong faces a rejection letter and a second purchase. Without seeing the complete picture on their own home, prospects either stall for weeks requesting in-home consultations, default to the cheapest vinyl option to minimize risk, or abandon the project altogether. Every one of those outcomes costs you money.`,
