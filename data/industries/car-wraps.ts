    paragraphs: [
      `Here's the cycle every wrap shop knows: a customer walks in or fills out a website form saying they want a color change or a custom design on their BMW. Your designer pulls the vehicle template, spends an hour or two mocking up the wrap in Avery or 3M's design tool, presents it — and then the customer says "let me think about it" and disappears forever. Or they come back six weeks later wanting a completely different color. You just donated two hours of skilled design labor to someone who was never serious. At $2,500 to $5,000 per full wrap job, every lost deal stings. But the wasted mockup time is the silent killer — it's an expense that never shows up on your P&L because you're paying your designer whether they're wrapping cars or creating free art for strangers.`,
      `The problem is structural. Vehicle wraps are a visual product that most customers have never purchased before. They can't picture what a matte midnight blue actually looks like on their specific car. They've seen photos on Instagram of other people's vehicles, but that Lamborghini Huracán in satin chrome doesn't help them visualize their Honda Accord in forest green. Without a way to preview the result on their actual vehicle, customers stay stuck in "just browsing" mode. They request mockup after mockup, trying to close the imagination gap with your designer's time and talent. And because the wrap industry has normalized free mockups as part of the sales process, every shop is trapped in the same cycle: give away design work for free, hope enough people convert to cover the cost of the ones who don't.`,
      `Meanwhile, your website is essentially a gallery. Photos of past work, maybe a color chart, a contact form. It does nothing to help a prospective customer see themselves in the product. The shops that win are the ones that can get a customer from "I'm curious" to "here's my deposit" with the least friction possible. Right now, the only way to do that is a custom mockup — and that's a bottleneck that doesn't scale. Vizzion eliminates the bottleneck entirely.`,

    {
      question: "How long does it take to set up Vizzion on my wrap shop website?",
      answer:
        `Under five minutes. You copy a single embed code and paste it into any page on your site — WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, or custom-built. No developer needed. The widget auto-adapts to your site's styling and is ready to capture leads immediately.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Can I upload my own color and finish options?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You can configure the widget with your full catalog of available wraps — specific 3M, Avery Dennison, Inozetek, or KPMF colors and finishes. Customers only see what you actually offer and can install, keeping expectations aligned with reality.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does it work with any vehicle type?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion works with any vehicle a customer can photograph — cars, trucks, SUVs, vans, motorcycles, boats, trailers, and fleet vehicles. The visualization adapts to the vehicle in the uploaded photo, so there are no template limitations.",
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are the wrap previews?",
      answer:
        `The previews are photo-realistic digital renderings that show the selected color and finish applied to the customer's actual vehicle. They're designed to give a strong visual representation of the final result — accurate enough to drive confident purchase decisions, while understanding that real-world lighting and material behavior will vary slightly from any digital preview.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Will this replace my designer entirely?",
      answer:
        `No — and it's not meant to. Vizzion replaces the free mockup stage: the speculative design work you do for prospects before they commit. Your designer still handles the final production files, custom graphics, partial wraps, and the detail work that turns a color-change preview into a print-ready file. Vizzion just makes sure they're doing that work for customers who have already put down a deposit.`,
    },
    {
      question: "How does Vizzion integrate with my booking or CRM system?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion supports direct integrations with popular CRMs and scheduling tools, plus webhooks and Zapier for custom setups. Leads arrive with the customer's contact info, vehicle photo, selected color and finish, and the preview image they generated — everything your team needs to follow up intelligently.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does Vizzion cost?",
      answer:
        `Vizzion offers tiered pricing based on the number of visualizations generated per month. There's a free tier to test the product on your site, and scaled plans for higher-volume shops. Since leads come from traffic you're already getting, most shops see a positive ROI within the first week. Contact us for current pricing.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Can customers preview partial wraps or custom graphics?",
      answer:
        "Currently, Vizzion excels at full color-change and finish previews. Support for partial wraps, custom graphics, and branded commercial designs is on the roadmap. For now, the widget is most effective for shops where color-change wraps represent a significant portion of revenue.",
