    paragraphs: [
      `You know the cycle. Someone inquires about a color change on their BMW. Your designer spends an hour or two mocking it up. The customer says "let me think about it" and vanishes. At $2,500 to $5,000 per full wrap, every ghosted deal hurts — but the real drain is the designer time you'll never get back. With wrap designers earning $27 to $44 per hour, those speculative mockups are costing you real money that never shows up on your P&L.`,
      `The root issue is that wraps are a visual product most people have never bought before. They can't picture matte midnight blue on their Accord just because they saw satin chrome on a Huracán on Instagram. So they request mockup after mockup, using your designer's time to close the imagination gap. The industry has normalized free mockups as part of sales, and every shop is stuck in the same trap: give away design labor and hope enough people convert to cover the ones who don't.`,
      `Meanwhile, your website is just a gallery — past work photos, a color chart, a contact form. It doesn't help anyone see themselves in the product. The shops that win are the ones who get customers from "I'm curious" to "here's my deposit" with the least friction. Right now that requires a custom mockup, and that's a bottleneck that doesn't scale.`,

We added Vizzion to our site two months ago and our designer hasn't touched a mockup for a cold lead since. Customers come in with the preview on their phone saying "I want exactly this." Our close rate on Vizzion leads is over 70%.`,

  faq: [
    {
      question: "How long does it take to set up Vizzion on my wrap shop website?",
      answer:
        `Under five minutes. You copy a single embed code and drop it on any page — most shops add it to their color gallery or portfolio page so customers can go from browsing past jobs to previewing wraps on their own vehicle. Works with WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, or any custom site. No developer needed.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Can I upload my own color and finish options?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You can configure the widget with your full catalog of available wraps — specific 3M, Avery Dennison, Inozetek, or KPMF colors and finishes. Customers only see what you actually offer and can install, keeping expectations aligned with reality.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does it work with any vehicle type?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion works with any vehicle a customer can photograph — cars, trucks, SUVs, vans, motorcycles, boats, trailers, and fleet vehicles. The visualization adapts to the vehicle in the uploaded photo, so there are no template limitations.",
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are the wrap previews?",
      answer:
        `The previews are photo-realistic digital renderings that show the selected color and finish applied to the customer's actual vehicle. They're designed to give a strong visual representation of the final result — accurate enough to drive confident purchase decisions, while understanding that real-world lighting and material behavior will vary slightly from any digital preview.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Will this replace my designer entirely?",
      answer:
        `No — and it's not meant to. Vizzion replaces the free mockup stage: the speculative design work you do for prospects before they commit. Your designer still handles the final production files, custom graphics, partial wraps, and the detail work that turns a color-change preview into a print-ready file. Vizzion just makes sure they're doing that work for customers who have already put down a deposit.`,
    },
    {
      question: "How does Vizzion integrate with my booking or CRM system?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion connects with ShopMonkey, Tekmetric, and other shop management platforms via direct integrations, webhooks, or Zapier. Every lead arrives with the customer's vehicle photo, chosen color and finish, and their preview image — so your team can quote accurately without a back-and-forth. It also plugs into scheduling tools like Calendly or Urable if you book consultations online.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does Vizzion cost?",
      answer:
        `There's a free tier to test on your site, with paid plans based on monthly visualization volume. To put it in perspective: one $3,500 full wrap job from a Vizzion lead covers months of the widget — and that's before you factor in the designer hours you're no longer burning on free mockups for people who ghost. Most shops are ROI-positive within the first week.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Can customers preview partial wraps or custom graphics?",
      answer:
        "Currently, Vizzion excels at full color-change and finish previews. Support for partial wraps, custom graphics, and branded commercial designs is on the roadmap. For now, the widget is most effective for shops where color-change wraps represent a significant portion of revenue.",
