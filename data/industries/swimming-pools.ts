      `The average inground pool runs $50,000 to $80,000 installed — and at that price, nobody signs a contract based on imagination. Homeowners spend months researching, requesting bids, and agonizing. The single biggest thing standing between you and a signed contract hasn't changed in decades: the homeowner can't picture what a pool will look like in their backyard. Not someone else's backyard. Theirs.`,
      `Most pool builders have 3D design tools like Pool Studio or Structure Studios — but those kick in after you've already driven to the property, measured the yard, and spent hours on a custom rendering. They help close deals, not generate them. Meanwhile, your website converts at 2 to 4 percent with a static contact form. The other 96% browse your gallery of other people's pools, maybe read some reviews, and leave. They were interested. They just weren't convinced yet.`,
      `Here's what makes pools different from every other home improvement sale: there's no showroom. A homeowner shopping for countertops can touch a sample. Someone buying windows can visit a display. But a $65,000 pool in a specific backyard with specific grading, trees, and a particular house? There's no sample for that. There's only imagination — and imagination doesn't get deposit checks signed. That gap between interest and commitment is exactly where Vizzion works.`,

      answer:
        `Under five minutes. Copy one embed snippet and drop it on your gallery of completed pools page, a dedicated "See a Pool in Your Backyard" landing page, or right on your homepage. No developer needed — the widget matches your site automatically and starts capturing leads the same day.`,

    {
      question: "How much does Vizzion cost for pool builders?",
      answer:
        "There's a free tier so you can test it with real traffic before committing. At $50K to $80K per pool project, ONE closed deal from a Vizzion lead pays for years of the widget. Compare that to spending $80 to $200+ per shared Angi lead where you're competing against half a dozen other builders for the same homeowner.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Vizzion work with different pool types — freeform, geometric, lap pools?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The visualization adapts to the homeowner's backyard and produces a realistic preview that fits their specific space. Whether you specialize in freeform gunite, geometric fiberglass, or plunge pools, the preview helps homeowners see the potential in their yard and take the next step.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is Vizzion different from Pool Studio or Structure Studios?",
      answer:
        "Pool Studio and Structure Studios are post-lead design tools — they help you create detailed 3D renderings after you've already visited the property, taken measurements, and qualified the prospect. Vizzion works at the top of the funnel, on your public website, to capture the lead in the first place. They're complementary: use Vizzion to generate the lead, then use your design software to close the sale.",
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of photos do homeowners need to upload?",
      answer:
        "Any reasonably clear photo of their backyard works — a phone photo taken from the back patio, a wide-angle shot from a second-story window, or even a drone image. The system handles a wide range of angles and image quality. If a photo is too blurry or obstructed, the widget prompts them to try another shot.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I customize the widget to match my company branding?",
      answer:
        `Fully white-label. Set your pool company name, logo, brand colors, and custom CTA text like "See a Pool in Your Backyard" or "Design Your Dream Pool." It looks and feels like a built-in feature of your website — homeowners interact with your brand from start to finish.`,
    },
    {
      question: "Does Vizzion integrate with my CRM or project management software?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Vizzion connects with the tools pool builders actually use — Buildertrend, CoConstruct, Jobber, Housecall Pro, plus HubSpot and Salesforce. It also works with any platform that accepts webhooks or Zapier triggers. Leads arrive with contact info, backyard photo, and visualization data ready for follow-up.",
    },
    {
      question: "Are the leads exclusive to my company?",
      answer:
        "100% exclusive. HomeAdvisor and Angi share every lead with 3 to 8 competing pool builders in your area — that's why close rates on those leads are so low. Vizzion leads come from your own website. The homeowner found you, saw a pool in their yard on your site, and gave you their email directly. No sharing, no bidding wars.",
