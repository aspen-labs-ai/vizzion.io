    headline: "Pool Sales Haven't Changed in 30 Years — But Buyer Expectations Have",
    paragraphs: [
      `A swimming pool is one of the largest purchases a homeowner will ever make outside of the house itself. The average inground pool project runs $50,000 to $80,000 fully installed — gunite, plaster, decking, equipment, landscaping. That number can climb past six figures for freeform designs, vanishing edges, or attached spas. At those price points, the sales cycle is measured in months, not days. Homeowners research obsessively, request multiple bids, and agonize over the decision. And throughout all of that deliberation, the single biggest barrier to a signed contract is the same thing it's been for decades: the homeowner cannot picture what a pool will actually look like in their backyard.`,
      `The tools most pool builders rely on haven't solved this. Some companies invest in 3D design software — Pool Studio, Structure Studios, PoolDraw — but those are post-lead design tools. They require a sales rep to visit the property, take measurements, and spend hours building a custom 3D rendering after the lead is already in the pipeline. They're essential for closing deals, but they do nothing to generate them. Meanwhile, your website — the first place most homeowners land when they start researching pool builders — converts at 2 to 4 percent with a static contact form. The other 96% of visitors look at your gallery photos of other people's pools, maybe read a few reviews, and leave without ever reaching out. They're interested, but not convinced. Not yet.`,
      `The pool industry has a unique problem that most home improvement categories don't face: the sheer scale of the decision combined with the total inability to preview the result. A homeowner considering new countertops can visit a showroom. Someone shopping for windows can see samples. But a $60,000 pool in a specific backyard with specific grading, existing landscaping, and a particular house style? There's no showroom for that. There's no sample. There's only imagination — and imagination isn't enough to justify writing a five-figure deposit check. That gap between interest and commitment is where you're losing your best prospects, and it's the gap Vizzion was designed to close.`,

        "Yes. The visualization adapts to the homeowner's backyard and produces a realistic preview that fits their specific space. Whether you specialize in freeform gunite, geometric fiberglass, or plunge pools, the preview helps homeowners see the potential in their yard and take the next step.",

      question: "How is Vizzion different from Pool Studio or Structure Studios?",
      answer:
        "Pool Studio and Structure Studios are post-lead design tools — they help you create detailed 3D renderings after you've already visited the property, taken measurements, and qualified the prospect. Vizzion works at the top of the funnel, on your public website, to capture the lead in the first place. They're complementary: use Vizzion to generate the lead, then use your design software to close the sale.",

      question: "What kind of photos do homeowners need to upload?",
      answer:
        "Any reasonably clear photo of their backyard works — a phone photo taken from the back patio, a wide-angle shot from a second-story window, or even a drone image. The system handles a wide range of angles and image quality. If a photo is too blurry or obstructed, the widget prompts them to try another shot.",

      question: "Can I customize the widget to match my company branding?",

The homeowner visited your site, engaged with your brand, and gave you their information directly. No sharing, no bidding wars, no race to the phone.",
