      "The Garage Door Industry Has a $6 Billion Visualization Problem",
    paragraphs: [
      `Garage doors account for 30 to 40 percent of a home's front-facing exterior. That makes them the single largest visual element on most houses — bigger than the front door, bigger than the windows, and far more noticeable than the siding trim. Remodeling Magazine's annual Cost vs. Value report consistently ranks garage door replacement as the top remodeling project for return on investment, with homeowners recovering roughly 94 cents on every dollar spent. The US garage door market exceeds $6 billion annually, with replacement projects ranging from $800 for a basic steel raised-panel door to $4,000 or more for a custom carriage house or modern aluminum-and-glass design. That's a huge market with enormous variation in style, material, and price — and the purchasing decision is almost entirely visual.`,
      `Here's the core problem: homeowners cannot visualize how a new garage door will look on their specific home. The style options are overwhelming. Traditional raised panel in white, almond, or dark walnut? Carriage house with decorative hardware and arched windows? Flush contemporary in charcoal with frosted glass inserts? Every manufacturer — Clopay, Amarr, Wayne Dalton, CHI Overhead Doors — offers dozens of styles, colors, and window insert patterns (arched, rectangular, prairie, Stockton, Waterford). The combinations easily reach into the hundreds. Homeowners know what they like in a catalog photo, but they have no idea how that door will look on their particular house with their particular brick color, roof pitch, driveway angle, and landscaping. That uncertainty kills deals.`,
      `Most garage door companies try to bridge this gap with before-and-after photo galleries from previous jobs. But those galleries show other people's homes, not the homeowner's home. A carriage house door looks stunning on a craftsman bungalow in the gallery — but will it look right on the homeowner's 1990s colonial with beige vinyl siding? They don't know, so they hesitate. They bookmark three different dealer websites, visit a showroom that has six display doors out of hundreds of options, and eventually either pick the safest choice (the same white raised-panel door they already have) or delay the project entirely. Dealers lose high-value upgrades because homeowners can't see the outcome before committing.`,
      `The sales process compounds the visualization gap. Most garage door dealers run their websites as digital brochures — a product catalog, an estimate request form, and maybe a gallery page. The typical website conversion rate for home services sits around 2 to 4 percent. For garage door companies, it's often lower because the product is so visual and the form asks the homeowner to describe what they want in words. "I want something modern but not too modern" tells your sales team nothing. Meanwhile, the homeowner who spent fifteen minutes browsing your Clopay catalog page and left without converting? That was a $3,000 sale that walked out the door. You'll never know they were there.`,
      `Storm damage and insurance claims add another dimension. Hail, wind, and impact damage drive a significant volume of garage door replacements — often on an accelerated timeline. These homeowners aren't leisurely browsing; they need a replacement fast, their insurance adjuster wants documentation, and they're comparing two or three dealers simultaneously. The company that helps them see exactly what the new door looks like on their home — quickly and on their terms — wins that job. Right now, nobody is doing that at the top of the funnel.`,

Compare it to what you're spending now: Angi and HomeAdvisor leads cost $65 to $120 each and are shared with multiple dealers.

        "Yes. Homeowners upload one photo of their home and can preview multiple styles — traditional raised panel, carriage house, modern flush, full-view glass, and more. They can compare different colors, window insert patterns (arched, rectangular, prairie, Stockton), and decorative hardware options, all on their actual home. This eliminates the guesswork that slows down purchasing decisions.",

        "Vizzion is brand-agnostic — it works with Clopay, Amarr, Wayne Dalton, CHI Overhead Doors, Raynor, and any other manufacturer. The visualization is style-based, so homeowners see realistic previews of door types (carriage house, flush panel, etc.) that map directly to the products in your showroom or catalog.",

      question: "How does Vizzion integrate with my CRM or lead management?",
      answer:
        "Direct integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, and other major CRMs. We also support webhooks and Zapier, so you can push leads into ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, JobNimbus, or whatever system your garage door company uses to manage estimates and appointments. Each lead arrives with the homeowner's email, home photo, and preferred door style attached.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Will homeowners uploading photos of their home create accurate previews?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion works with a wide range of image quality — phone photos, Google Street View screenshots, and even slightly angled shots. The system identifies the garage area and generates a realistic preview of the new door on their specific home. For best results, a straight-on photo of the front of the house works great, but the widget handles most angles well and prompts for a clearer photo if needed.",

        "Can I customize the widget to match my company's branding?",
      answer:
        'Fully white-label. Match your brand colors and logo, set custom CTA text like "See Your New Garage Door" or "Preview Doors on Your Home," and control the messaging end to end. Homeowners experience it as a built-in feature of your site, not a third-party tool. Many dealers embed it directly on their product catalog pages for a seamless experience.',

    {
      question:
        "How does Vizzion help me sell higher-value garage doors?",
      answer:
        "When homeowners can only look at catalog photos, they tend to pick the safest, cheapest option. When they see a premium carriage house door with decorative hardware on their actual home — and see how it transforms their curb appeal — they consistently choose higher-value options. Dealers using Vizzion report average ticket increases of 30-50% because homeowners can finally see what they're paying for before committing.",
