    headline: "Fence Companies Are Losing Deals They Should Be Winning",
    paragraphs: [
      `The U.S. fencing market generates over $8 billion annually, and it's growing — driven by new home construction, aging infrastructure, and a post-pandemic wave of backyard investment. The average residential fence installation runs $2,500 to $8,000 depending on material and linear footage, with premium projects like wrought iron or composite easily pushing past $12,000. That makes every qualified lead worth serious money. But the way most fence companies generate and close those leads hasn't changed in decades.`,
      `Here's the core problem: fencing is one of the hardest home improvement products to visualize before purchase. A homeowner can picture a new coat of paint or a kitchen remodel by looking at photos. But a fence wraps around an entire property. Its impact depends on the yard's shape, the existing landscaping, the slope of the terrain, the color of the house, and the sightlines from the street and the neighbors. No amount of stock photography or showroom panels can replicate that. A cedar privacy fence sample looks warm and inviting on a display rack — but what does 150 feet of it look like bordering the homeowner's actual backyard, next to their deck, their garden beds, their pool enclosure? They genuinely cannot picture it. And when people can't picture a $5,000 purchase, they stall.`,
      `Most fence companies try to bridge this gap with physical sample kits, photo galleries on their website, and in-home consultations where the estimator walks the property line and describes the finished look. The photo galleries show other people's yards — never the prospect's. The sample kits show material and color but not scale or context. And the in-home estimate costs you a truck roll, an hour of a salesperson's time, and often produces a proposal that sits in someone's email inbox for weeks while they "think about it." Meanwhile, vinyl fencing — the fastest-growing segment at roughly 7% annual growth — has 40+ color and style combinations that compound the visualization problem. Privacy vs. semi-privacy vs. picket vs. ranch rail vs. ornamental. Flat cap vs. New England cap vs. gothic point. Tan vs. clay vs. white vs. gray. The permutation count overwhelms homeowners who just want to see what looks right on their property.`,
      `Then there's the competitive landscape. Fence companies are increasingly competing with big-box retailers like Home Depot and Lowe's, which offer free installation estimates and slick online tools. Aggregator sites sell shared leads at $30 to $75 each, and those leads go to three or four contractors simultaneously — creating a race to the bottom on price. Your website might get decent traffic, especially during spring and summer peak season, but a standard contact form converts 2 to 4 percent of visitors. The other 96% browse your gallery, maybe check your service area, and disappear. They were interested enough to visit your site. They just couldn't close the mental gap between "browsing" and "ready to buy." That gap is the single biggest leak in the fencing sales funnel — and it's exactly where Vizzion fits.`,

        "Under five minutes. Copy one embed snippet onto your website — a landing page, your fence gallery page, or homepage. The widget matches your site branding automatically. Works with WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, or any custom site. No developer or IT team needed. Most fence companies have it live the same day.",

      answer:
        "There's a free tier to start. Paid plans scale with visualization volume. Compare that to aggregator leads at $30 to $75 each — shared with three to four competitors. A single closed fence job at $4,000 to $8,000 pays for months of Vizzion. Most fence companies hit positive ROI within the first two weeks of peak season.",

        "Direct integrations with HubSpot, Salesforce, and JobNimbus. We also support Zapier and webhooks, so you can push leads into Jobber, ServiceTitan, CompanyCam, or any other tool your crew uses. Each lead arrives with the homeowner's email, property photo, fence style preference, and engagement data attached — giving your estimator real context before they call.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from just having a good photo gallery on my site?",
      answer:
        "Photo galleries show other people's yards with other people's fences. They're helpful social proof, but they don't answer the homeowner's real question: \"What will it look like on MY property?\" Vizzion answers that question directly. The homeowner sees their yard, their landscaping, their house — with the fence they're considering installed at full scale. That's the difference between browsing and buying.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can homeowners compare different fence styles side by side?",
      answer:
        "Yes. A homeowner can try cedar privacy, then swap to white vinyl picket, then check black aluminum ornamental — all on their same yard photo. This is especially valuable for fence companies that carry multiple material lines. Instead of lugging sample panels to every estimate, the homeowner narrows their preference before you ever leave the shop.",

      question: "Does Vizzion work during the off-season?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely — and that's a hidden advantage. Fall and winter are when many homeowners start researching and planning spring projects. Vizzion captures those early-stage leads on your website year-round. When a homeowner previews a fence on their yard in November, they're already a warm lead when your spring schedule opens. You build pipeline during the slow months instead of starting cold every March.",
