    paragraphs: [
      `The US countertop market is worth $28 billion, and the average kitchen countertop project runs $4,000 to $8,000 installed. That's a serious purchase — and homeowners treat it like one. They visit your showroom, hold sample chips up to their cabinet doors under fluorescent lighting, squint at 2-inch squares of Calacatta Gold, and try to imagine what 40 square feet of it will look like in their kitchen. They can't. Nobody can. A polished chip the size of a credit card tells you almost nothing about how veining will flow across an L-shaped island or how a busy granite pattern will look next to existing backsplash tile.`,
      `So they leave. They visit two more showrooms. They schedule a slab yard appointment, then reschedule it, then cancel. Industry data shows 67% of homeowners who receive a countertop quote ultimately ghost — not because the price was wrong, but because they couldn't commit to a material they've never truly seen at scale. The gap between a sample chip and an installed countertop is the single biggest conversion killer in the stone business. And every week a customer hesitates is another week they might find a competitor, change their mind entirely, or decide to just keep their old laminate.`,
      `Meanwhile, the big brands have tried to solve this with generic room designers. Cambria's AR visualizer, Caesarstone's online room planner, Silestone's design tool — they all drop their stones into a stock kitchen that looks nothing like your customer's actual space. A white shaker kitchen render doesn't help someone with cherry cabinets and a terracotta backsplash. These tools sell the brand's catalog, not your customer's confidence. There's a gap between the showroom visit and the signed fabrication order — and that's exactly where Vizzion lives.`,

      question: "Can customers see different countertop materials — granite, quartz, marble — in their actual kitchen?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Customers upload a photo of their kitchen and can preview any countertop material you offer — granite, quartz, marble, quartzite, soapstone, or any other surface. They see the stone in their actual space with their existing cabinets, backsplash, and lighting, not a generic stock kitchen. They can compare multiple materials side by side to narrow their selection before visiting your showroom.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does Vizzion handle the unique veining patterns in natural stone?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion renders realistic stone textures including veining, movement, and color variation that represent each material faithfully. While every individual slab of natural stone is unique, the visualization gives customers an accurate sense of the material's character, scale, and how its pattern will flow across their specific countertop layout. It bridges the gap between a 4-inch sample and a 40-square-foot installation.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is Vizzion different from Cambria's or Caesarstone's visualizers?",
      answer:
        "Brand visualizers like Cambria's AR tool and Caesarstone's room designer drop their specific catalog into a generic stock kitchen. Vizzion does the opposite: it puts any material into the customer's actual kitchen. That's a fundamental difference. Brand tools sell their catalog. Vizzion sells your customer's confidence — and captures their contact info for your business, not the manufacturer's.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does it work for bathroom vanities and not just kitchens?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Customers can upload photos of bathrooms, laundry rooms, wet bars, outdoor kitchens — any space where countertops are being considered. The visualization works the same way regardless of the room. Many fabricators use Vizzion across multiple landing pages targeting different project types.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does Vizzion cost for countertop fabricators?",
      answer:
        "There's a free tier to test the product and scaled plans based on monthly visualization volume. Compare it to your current cost per lead and the margin on a typical $5,800 kitchen countertop project. One closed deal pays for months of Vizzion. Most countertop shops see positive ROI within the first two weeks.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I show only the brands and slabs I carry in my showroom?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You control which materials appear in the visualization. If you carry Cambria, MSI, and Daltile but not Caesarstone, you configure the widget to show only your inventory. This keeps the customer experience honest — they only preview stones you can actually sell and fabricate, eliminating disappointment and wasted time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Vizzion integrate with my countertop quoting software?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion integrates with popular CRMs including Salesforce, HubSpot, and JobNimbus via direct integrations, plus any other tool via webhooks and Zapier. Leads arrive with the customer's email, kitchen photo, and material preferences attached. You can route them directly into your quoting workflow — whether that's CounterGo, Moraware, or a custom system.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if the customer's kitchen photo has poor lighting?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion is built to work with real-world photos — phone cameras, uneven lighting, slightly angled shots. The system identifies the countertop surfaces and generates a realistic preview regardless of perfect conditions. For extremely dark or blurry images, the widget prompts the customer to try a clearer photo, keeping the experience smooth without frustrating them.",
