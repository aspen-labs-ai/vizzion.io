Your customers are drowning in options — 47 shades of oak, 30 LVP patterns, endless tile formats. A 3-inch sample board tells them almost nothing about how a floor will look across 1,500 square feet of living space. Vizzion lets them upload a photo of their actual room and see any floor installed in seconds. They enter their email to save the preview. You get a qualified lead who already knows what they want.",

    paragraphs: [
      `Flooring is the largest home improvement category in the US — a $48 billion market — and it has one of the highest rates of buyer hesitation in all of home improvement. The average hardwood flooring project runs $6,000 to $12,000 installed. That's a significant commitment for something most customers have never seen at scale in a space that looks anything like their own. They hold a 3-by-3-inch sample against their existing floor, squint, try to imagine 1,500 square feet of it, and freeze. So they go back to the showroom. Again. And again.`,
      `The data backs this up: the typical flooring customer makes three to five showroom visits before committing, stretching the decision timeline to six to eight weeks. Each visit costs your sales team time, and every week of deliberation is another week the customer might find a competitor, change their mind, or simply abandon the project. Meanwhile, 26% of flooring jobs end in change orders or remakes — the customer picked a color that looked perfect on the sample board but wrong across an entire kitchen. That mistake costs you margins, time, and referrals.`,
      `Manufacturer tools like Mohawk's ColorCenter and Shaw's design visualizers exist, but they drop your customer's photo into a generic room template — a sterile, perfectly lit showroom that looks nothing like their 1970s split-level with dark cabinets and north-facing windows. The gap between a manufacturer's demo room and the customer's actual living space is where confidence dies and sales stall. Vizzion closes that gap by showing every floor option in the customer's real room, with their real lighting, furniture, and layout.`,

      question: "How does Vizzion handle different room lighting and angles?",
      answer:
        "Vizzion works with a wide range of room photos — different lighting conditions, angles, and layouts. Whether the room is brightly lit with natural light or has warm artificial lighting, the flooring preview adjusts to match the environment in the photo. Customers get a realistic sense of how the floor will actually look in their space, not a flat overlay that ignores the room's character.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can customers compare hardwood vs LVP vs tile in the same room photo?",
      answer:
        "Yes — and this is one of the most powerful features for flooring retailers. Customers can swap between hardwood species, LVP patterns, tile layouts, and carpet textures in the same room photo without re-uploading. That side-by-side comparison in their actual space is what breaks decision paralysis and moves them from browsing to buying.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is Vizzion different from Mohawk's or Shaw's online visualizers?",
      answer:
        "Manufacturer visualizers like Mohawk's ColorCenter and Shaw's design tools use generic room templates — a perfectly staged kitchen or living room that looks nothing like the customer's actual home. Vizzion uses the customer's own room photo, so they see flooring in their real space with their real lighting and furniture. It also captures their email as a lead for your business, which manufacturer tools don't do.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does it work for commercial flooring projects?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. Commercial clients — property managers, office designers, restaurant owners — can upload photos of their actual spaces and preview flooring options just like residential customers. For commercial flooring contractors, Vizzion speeds up the specification and approval process by letting stakeholders see options in the real space before committing.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does Vizzion cost for flooring retailers?",
      answer:
        "There's a free tier to test the product and scaled plans based on monthly visualization volume. Compare it to your current costs: physical sample programs run $350 or more per serious prospect, and every week of customer deliberation is another week they might visit a competitor. One closed flooring job at $8,000 or more pays for months of Vizzion.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Vizzion integrate with my showroom POS or CRM?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Direct integrations with Salesforce, HubSpot, and the CRMs flooring retailers commonly use. We also support webhooks and Zapier, so you can push leads into FloorForce, QFloors, Measure Square, or any other tool in your stack. Each lead arrives with the customer's email, room photo, styles they previewed, and engagement data attached.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I limit the styles shown to only brands I carry?",
      answer:
        "Fully configurable. You control exactly which flooring products, brands, colors, and styles appear in the widget. Show only the lines you stock — whether that's exclusively Mohawk LVP, a curated selection of domestic hardwoods, or your full catalog. Customers only see options you can actually sell and install.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if the room photo has furniture in it?",
      answer:
        "Most room photos have furniture, and Vizzion handles it well. The system identifies the visible floor area and applies the flooring preview to those sections, working around furniture, rugs, and other objects in the room. Customers get a realistic sense of the new floor in their lived-in space — which is actually more useful than seeing it in an empty room.",
