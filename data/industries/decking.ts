      "The Decking Industry Has a $8 Billion Problem — And It Starts in the Showroom",
    paragraphs: [
      `The U.S. residential decking market generates over $8 billion annually, with more than 4 million decks built or replaced every year. That demand is only accelerating — composite decking alone is growing 5 to 7 percent per year as homeowners shift away from pressure-treated lumber toward low-maintenance alternatives like Trex, TimberTech, Azek, and Fiberon. The average deck build or replacement now runs $15,000 to $35,000, making it one of the largest outdoor improvement projects a homeowner will ever take on. For deck builders and remodelers, every qualified lead represents serious revenue.`,

      `But here's where the funnel breaks. Composite manufacturers like Trex offer 25 to 30 color options. TimberTech has another 20-plus. Add in board width choices (standard vs. wide plank), railing styles (cable, aluminum, composite, glass), fascia color, and the need to coordinate everything with the home's siding, trim, and roof color — and you've handed the homeowner 500 possible combinations with no practical way to compare them. The result is analysis paralysis at scale. Builders report that 30 to 40 percent of qualified prospects stall in the material selection phase, many for months. Some never come back at all. That's not a lead quality problem — it's a visualization problem.`,

      `The traditional tools don't help. Color swatches and small sample boards can't show how a full deck surface looks in context. Manufacturer visualizers — like the Trex Deck Starter or TimberTech Deck Designer — are generic renderers that drop preset deck shapes onto stock photos of someone else's house. They don't show your prospect's actual backyard, their specific siding color, or how the deck will look from their kitchen window. And critically, these manufacturer tools sit on the manufacturer's website, not yours. Every prospect you send to Trex.com to "explore colors" is a prospect who may never come back to your site. You're handing your traffic to a manufacturer who also lists your competitors.`,

      `The seasonal pressure compounds the problem. Deck building is intensely seasonal — spring through early fall in most markets, with the selling season effectively running January through May for summer builds. Builders need to lock in contracts during winter proposal season to fill their spring and summer calendars. But that's exactly when homeowners are least able to visualize outdoor projects — they're looking at a snow-covered or dormant backyard and trying to imagine a $25,000 composite deck. Without a tangible visual, the default decision is to wait. Waiting means another builder gets the contract, or the project dies entirely.`,

      `Most deck builders rely on referrals and word-of-mouth, supplemented by home show appearances and local lead services like Angi, HomeAdvisor, or Houzz. Those platforms charge $15 to $75 per lead — and the leads are shared with three to five other builders in your area. Your close rate on shared leads typically runs 8 to 12 percent because you're racing three other contractors to the first callback. Meanwhile, your own website — the one place where the homeowner has already chosen your company — converts at 2 to 4 percent. The 96-plus percent who leave without contacting you aren't uninterested. They're undecided. They can't picture the finished product, so they can't pull the trigger.`,

      question:
        "How does Vizzion help with composite decking color selection specifically?",
      answer:
        "Composite manufacturers like Trex, TimberTech, Azek, and Fiberon each offer 20 to 30 color options — and colors look dramatically different depending on the home's siding, trim, and landscaping. Vizzion lets homeowners see each color option on their actual backyard, against their specific house exterior. Instead of guessing from a tiny swatch, they compare Trex Havana Gold vs. Tiki Torch vs. Lava Rock right on their property. This eliminates the most common stall point in the deck sales process: weeks of indecision over color.",

      question: "How much does Vizzion cost for deck builders?",
      answer:
        "There's a free tier to test the product and scaled plans based on monthly visualization volume. Consider the math: your average deck project is $15,000 to $35,000. A single additional closed deal more than covers a full year of Vizzion. Compare that to Angi leads at $15 to $75 each — shared with multiple competitors — and the ROI is immediate.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How is this different from the deck visualizers on Trex.com or TimberTech.com?",
      answer:
        "Manufacturer visualizers like Trex Deck Starter and TimberTech Deck Designer use generic 3D renderers with stock backgrounds. They don't show the homeowner's actual backyard, siding, or landscaping. More importantly, those tools live on the manufacturer's website — every prospect you send there might never return to your site. Vizzion puts the visualization on your website, under your brand, and captures the lead for you. The homeowner never leaves your domain.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can homeowners compare different materials side by side?",
      answer:
        "Yes. A homeowner can preview composite, pressure-treated wood, hardwood, and PVC decking on their actual backyard and switch between color options within each material. They can also try different railing styles — cable, aluminum, composite, or glass panel — to see the full picture. This is the key advantage: instead of imagining from swatches, they see real combinations on their real property.",

      question: "Does Vizzion integrate with my CRM?",
      answer:
        "Direct integrations with HubSpot, Salesforce, JobNimbus, and other CRMs commonly used by contractors. We also support webhooks and Zapier for tools like Buildertrend, CoConstruct, or any other platform in your stack. Each lead arrives with the homeowner's email, backyard photo, the specific materials and colors they explored, and the combination they saved.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does Vizzion handle seasonal selling challenges?",
      answer:
        "Deck building is seasonal, but selling doesn't have to be. During winter proposal season (January through April), homeowners can upload a summer or fall photo of their backyard and preview deck options from their couch. This lets you lock in contracts during winter for spring builds — instead of waiting for warm weather to start your sales process. Builders in cold-weather markets see the biggest impact during Q1 when visualization is hardest without a tool like Vizzion.",

      question: "What data do I get with each lead?",

        "Every Vizzion lead includes the homeowner's email address, their backyard photo, the specific deck materials and colors they explored, the final combination they saved, and engagement data like time spent and number of options tried.
