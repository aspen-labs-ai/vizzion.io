## Research Reports

### 1. [Consumer Psychology Research](./vizzion-consumer-psychology-research.md)
**Produced:** February 7, 2026 · ~4,575 words

Deep analysis of 20 high-emotion, high-stakes purchase categories where visualization is the conversion tipping point — where seeing the result on YOUR specific photo bridges the gap between "interested" and "ready to buy."

**Key findings:**
- The **"Identity Gap"** is the conversion killer — buyers need to see THEMSELVES in the result, not generic examples
- The **"Professional Rendering" gap** is the business opportunity — industries already pay $500–$20K for manual renderings Vizzion can automate
- **"Upload = Intent Signal"** — a photo upload expresses dramatically more purchase intent than a contact form
- Top 3 verticals by psychological impact: home exterior, tattoo/cosmetic/smile, landscape/hardscape
- Organized into Tier 1 (Game-changers), Tier 2 (High Impact), and Tier 3 (High Potential) with a summary matrix of all 20 industries

---

### 2. [Emerging Trends Report](./vizzion-emerging-trends-report.md)
**Produced:** February 7, 2026 · ~4,990 words

Forward-looking analysis of 20 non-obvious and emerging applications for photo-based visualization, mapped against 2026–2031 market trajectories. Focuses on where the market is heading, not just where it is.

**Key findings:**
- Global AR market projected $120B (2025) → $1T+ by 2033 at ~30% CAGR
- **EV charger installation preview** is a 9/10 fit with $200B+ infrastructure market and virtually no competition
- **ADU visualization** rated 9/10 — highest individual ticket ($100K–$300K) with ADU legislation exploding in 40+ states
- **Green building retrofit** is IRA-driven with $600B+ global market and no visualization tools
- Top 5 "Act Now": ADU, Holiday Lighting, Green Retrofit, Window Treatments, Landscape/Hardscape
- Wildcard: **Marketplace white-label** (Thumbtack, Houzz, Angi) as a parallel strategic track

### 3. [Industry Expansion Report](./vizzion-industry-expansion-report.md)
**Produced:** February 7, 2026 · ~4,188 words

The master synthesis — consolidates findings from all 4 independent research angles (visualization anxiety, fragmented markets, emerging trends, consumer psychology) into a cross-validated ranking of ~40 unique industries.

**Key findings:**
- **84 industry entries** across 4 reports de-duplicate to ~40 unique verticals
- US addressable businesses: **~1.5M+** across all verticals; at $100–$200/mo = $1.8B–$3.6B TAM
- Vizzion's white space is **not new technology — it's a new distribution model** (affordable, embeddable, lead-gen-first for the long tail)
- Industries appearing in ALL 4 reports (highest confidence): Exterior Painting, Hardscaping, Tattoos, Vehicle Wraps
- **Recommended 4-phase launch sequence:** Surface swaps → Exterior bundle → New surfaces → Advanced (3D/facial)
- Clear list of **industries to AVOID**: Flooring (Roomvo dominates), Pet Grooming (bad unit economics), Virtual Staging (crowded), General Furniture (Amazon AR)

---

### 4. [Market Research (Fragmented Industries)](./vizzion-market-research.md)
**Produced:** February 7, 2026 · ~4,158 words

Analysis of 20 fragmented industries through the lens of small-business willingness to pay. Evaluated each on: number of US businesses, average deal size, current lead gen brokenness, likelihood of paying $50–$200/mo, and technical feasibility.

**Key findings:**
- Top 5 verticals by business-model fit: Vehicle Wraps (A+), Fencing (A+), House Painting (A+), Hardscaping (A), Flooring (A — but Roomvo caveat)
- The **"Mockup Replacement" angle** is the strongest pitch — businesses already do manual Photoshop mockups, Vizzion replaces labor AND captures leads
- Pitch framing: "Stop wasting 2 hours doing free mockups for tire-kickers"
- Painting contractors is the largest addressable market (~300K businesses)
- Pet grooming is a clear AVOID — deal size too low, groomers are capacity-constrained not lead-constrained

### 5. [Visualization Anxiety Research](./vizzion-visualization-anxiety-research.md)
**Produced:** February 7, 2026 · ~6,398 words

The deepest single report — 24 industries ranked by a composite score of visualization gap severity, ticket size, lead gen value, and technical feasibility. Includes detailed competitive landscape analysis.

**Key findings:**
- **Tier 1 targets** (severe gap + high ticket + high feasibility): Exterior Remodeling, Roofing, Windows/Doors, Exterior Painting, Hardscaping
- Detailed competitive landscape map: Roomvo (flooring fortress), Renoworks (enterprise exteriors), ModiFace (brand-locked beauty), InkHunter (app-only tattoos)
- Vizzion's strategic white space: **lightweight, embeddable, affordable widgets for the long tail of 1.5M+ small/mid businesses**
- Fencing, Tattoos, Holiday Lighting, Artificial Turf, and Vehicle Wraps all have **ZERO** embeddable widget competition
- Total US TAM at $50–$200/mo per business: $900M–$3.6B annually; 1% penetration = $18M ARR

### 6. [Solar SEO & Conversion Research](./vizzion-solar-seo-research.md)
**Produced:** February 6, 2026 · ~4,488 words

Comprehensive research for the solar industry landing page — keywords, SEO strategy, competitor analysis (Aurora Solar, Solargraf, OpenSolar, Hover, Roofr, EagleView, Enerflo), conversion copy frameworks, and solar industry pain points.

**Key findings:**
- Primary keyword target: "solar lead generation widget" / "solar visualization widget"
- Vizzion's unique positioning: the ONLY tool focused on **pre-lead conversion** (website visitor → lead); every competitor focuses on post-lead (design, proposals, financing)
- **Roofr's Instant Estimator** is the closest business-model analog — website widget that engages homeowners and captures leads
- Solar CAC averages $3,000–$6,000 per install; the #2 sales objection (after cost) is aesthetics
- Recommended page structure with 10 sections, schema markup strategy, and content cluster plan
- Messaging hierarchy: Lead generation > Simplicity > Visualization > Email capture > Differentiation

## Strategy & Plans

### 7. [Marketing Skills Integration Plan](./vizzion-marketingskills-plan.md)
**Produced:** February 7, 2026 · ~1,136 words

Plan for integrating the `coreyhaines31/marketingskills` Claude Code skills repo (25 marketing-focused skills for CRO, copywriting, SEO, analytics) into the Vizzion project workflow.

**What it covers:**
- **Phase 1 (Foundation):** Create `product-marketing-context.md` — the keystone file all other skills reference
- **Phase 2 (Active Use):** CRO audits on homepage and solar page, copywriting improvements, schema validation, programmatic SEO strategy
- **Phase 3 (Growth):** Competitor/alternative pages, content strategy, lead form optimization, marketing psychology review
- Priority install order for skills and which to skip (AB testing, paid ads — premature)
- **Biggest single win:** Creating the product marketing context file (now done at `.claude/product-marketing-context.md`)

### 8. [Solar Landing Page Plan](./vizzion-solar-page-plan.md)
**Produced:** February 6, 2026 · ~2,167 words

Detailed architectural plan for the `/industries/solar` landing page — the first of 12 planned industry-specific pages built on a data-driven template.

**What it covers:**
- Full `IndustryData` TypeScript interface for templatized industry pages
- 11-section page structure with content, design notes, and component mapping for each
- Component reuse strategy: 6 new, 5 adapted, 3 direct reuse from existing site
- File/route architecture for scaling from solar → 12 industries via `[slug]` dynamic routing
- SEO targets, visual needs, interactive elements, and Core Web Vitals performance targets
- Technical approach: server-side rendered, lazy-loaded, async widget embed
