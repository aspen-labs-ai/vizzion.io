# Vizzion.io — Fragmented Industry Market Research
## Beyond Home Improvement: Where the Widget Works

*Research compiled Feb 7, 2026*

---

## Executive Summary

Vizzion's "upload photo → see result → enter email → get lead" widget has potential far beyond its current home improvement focus. The ideal target industry has: thousands of small businesses with websites, visual transformations that vary by customer, deal sizes above $500, and no existing great visualization tool.

After researching 20 industries across trades, personal services, events, agriculture, pets, hospitality, real estate, and retail — I've identified **Tier 1 targets** (highest confidence), **Tier 2** (strong potential with caveats), and **Tier 3** (interesting but harder).

---

## TIER 1 — HIGHEST CONFIDENCE (Go after these)

---

### 1. 🚗 Vehicle Wraps & Custom Auto Paint
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their car/truck/van → sees it with a custom wrap design, color change, or commercial branding applied.

- **US Businesses:** ~5,000–8,000 dedicated wrap shops (subset of 33,761 auto body/paint shops, NAICS 811121). Growing fast — vehicle wrap market was $5B+ globally in 2024.
- **Average Deal Size:** $2,500–$5,000 for a full wrap; $1,000–$2,000 for partials. Commercial fleet wraps: $3,000–$10,000 per vehicle.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Instagram portfolios, Google/Yelp listings, word of mouth. **Broken because:** Customers can't envision THEIR vehicle with a specific design. Shops waste hours doing mockup renders in Photoshop/Illustrator for prospects who may not convert.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES — Strong.** These businesses already spend on mockup labor ($50–100/hr designer time). A tool that automates this AND captures leads is a no-brainer. $150/mo is one partial wrap away from ROI.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **HIGH.** Vehicle wraps are ideal — cars are well-defined 3D objects, the wrap is a surface overlay. AI can detect vehicle contours and apply color/pattern/graphics realistically. Companies like 3M already have virtual wrap tools but they're B2B-to-manufacturer, not for the local shop's website.

**⭐ WHY THIS IS #1:** Fragmented market of tech-savvy small businesses (they're already on Instagram), high ticket, clear visual transformation, shops literally do manual mockups today that this replaces.

---

### 2. 🏗️ Fencing Contractors
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their yard/property → sees different fence styles (vinyl, wood, chain-link, iron, composite) installed along their property line.

- **US Businesses:** ~20,000–30,000 fencing contractors. AFA has 1,400+ member companies across 19 chapters, but the industry is much larger. NAICS 238990 (specialty trade) includes fencing among 46,275 businesses.
- **Average Deal Size:** $3,000–$8,000 for residential; $10,000–$50,000+ for commercial.
- **Current Lead Gen:** HomeAdvisor/Angi leads ($30–80 per lead, often shared with 3+ competitors), Google Ads, yard signs. **Broken because:** Leads from aggregators are expensive and low-quality (shared). Customers struggle to visualize fence styles on their specific property.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES.** At $5K average deal and $50+ lead cost from aggregators, even 1 extra closed deal per quarter from their own website makes this pay for itself many times over.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **HIGH.** Fence lines are linear and follow property boundaries. AI can detect the yard/ground plane and overlay fence segments along it. Simpler than most home reno visualizations.

---

### 3. 🎨 House Painting (Exterior + Interior)
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their house exterior (or room interior) → sees it repainted in selected colors.

- **US Businesses:** 30,209 verified painting & wall covering contractors (NAICS 238320).
- **Average Deal Size:** $3,000–$6,000 for exterior; $1,500–$4,000 for interior per room/area.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Google Ads, Angi/HomeAdvisor, Nextdoor, yard signs. **Broken because:** Color samples on tiny swatches ≠ seeing your actual house in that color. The Sherwin-Williams/Benjamin Moore color visualizers exist but they're manufacturer tools, not lead gen tools. They don't capture emails for the painter.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES — Strong.** 30K+ businesses, many already paying for digital marketing. A widget that helps a homeowner see colors on THEIR house and captures their email? Painters would love this. Differentiation from competitors who just show generic portfolios.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **VERY HIGH.** This is one of the most proven AI visualization use cases. Color transfer on surfaces is computationally well-understood. Multiple apps already do this (but as consumer-facing tools, not B2B lead gen widgets).

**Note:** Sherwin-Williams ColorSnap Visualizer and similar tools exist but they're brand-specific, not embeddable lead gen widgets for individual painting companies.

---

### 4. 🪨 Hardscaping / Patio / Concrete Contractors
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their backyard → sees a new patio, walkway, retaining wall, or driveway in different materials (pavers, stamped concrete, natural stone).

- **US Businesses:** ~15,000–25,000 dedicated hardscape companies (subset of masonry contractors: 9,848 + significant overlap with landscaping: 76,769 and specialty trade: 46,275).
- **Average Deal Size:** $5,000–$15,000 for patios; $3,000–$8,000 for walkways; $10,000–$30,000+ for full outdoor living spaces.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Google Ads, Houzz portfolio, HomeAdvisor. **Broken because:** Customers spend weeks browsing Pinterest but can't see how specific materials look in their specific space with their specific house style.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES.** High-ticket, long sales cycles. Anything that moves a prospect from "browsing" to "requesting a quote" is valuable.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **HIGH.** Ground-plane detection + texture replacement. The outdoor setting has good lighting. Paver patterns and stone textures can be convincingly overlaid on flat/contoured ground.

---

### 5. 🏠 Flooring Contractors / Retailers
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their room → sees new flooring (hardwood, LVP, tile, carpet) installed in the space.

- **US Businesses:** 13,108 flooring contractors (NAICS 238330) + thousands of independent flooring retail stores. Floor & Decor has ~200 locations, but the market is overwhelmingly independent dealers/installers.
- **Average Deal Size:** $3,000–$8,000 per room/area for materials + installation.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Showroom foot traffic, Google, Angi. **Broken because:** Samples look different in-store vs. at home. The #1 barrier is "will this look good in MY room?"
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES.** Some manufacturers (Shaw, Mohawk) have room visualizers, but they don't capture leads for the local dealer. A widget on the local flooring store's website that captures homeowner emails? Absolutely.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **VERY HIGH.** Floor-plane detection is one of the easiest AR/visualization tasks. Room-view flooring preview is a solved problem technically. Just needs packaging as a lead gen widget.

---

### 6. 🌿 Landscape Design / Full-Service Landscaping
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their front or back yard → sees landscaping concepts: plantings, garden beds, trees, pathways, lighting, water features.

- **US Businesses:** 76,769 landscaping services (NAICS 561730). This is the LARGEST category by business count.
- **Average Deal Size:** $5,000–$15,000 for design + install; $20,000–$50,000+ for full outdoor transformations.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Google Ads, Houzz, referrals, yard signs, Angi/Thumbtack. **Broken because:** Landscape design is hard to visualize from a portfolio. Every yard is different. Companies offer "free design consultations" which cost them $200–500 in labor per prospect.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES.** With 76K businesses, even modest penetration = massive TAM. Landscapers above the "mow and go" tier care deeply about leads for design-build projects.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **MEDIUM-HIGH.** More complex than paint or flooring because you're adding organic 3D elements (plants, trees) to varied outdoor scenes. But AI image generation has gotten remarkable at this. A stylized "concept visualization" rather than photo-exact rendering would work perfectly.

---

## TIER 2 — STRONG POTENTIAL (Worth building for)

---

### 7. 🖼️ Tattoo Studios
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their arm/back/etc. → sees a tattoo design placed on their body in the correct position, scale, and with realistic skin curvature.

- **US Businesses:** 23,774 tattoo studios (IBISWorld 2025); $1.3B industry revenue, growing at 10.9% CAGR.
- **Average Deal Size:** $200–$500 for medium pieces; $500–$2,000+ for large custom work; $2,000–$10,000+ for full sleeves/back pieces.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Instagram (primary), walk-ins, word of mouth. **Broken because:** Artists spend hours doing free consultations and custom sketches for people who don't show up. There's no way for a customer to "try before they buy" on their own body.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **MAYBE — Honest assessment: 50/50.** Tattoo artists are famously anti-corporate and tech-skeptical. Many are solo operators or booth renters who think $50/mo is steep. However, the TOP shops (those charging $150+/hr) absolutely would. Target the higher-end studios, not the walk-in flash shops.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **HIGH.** Body-part detection + image overlay with skin-tone matching and curvature warping. InkHunter and similar apps have proven this works. The lead-gen angle (email capture for consultation booking) is the differentiator.

---

### 8. 🪟 Window & Door Replacement Companies
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their house → sees new windows/doors (different styles, materials, colors) replacing existing ones.

- **US Businesses:** ~10,000–15,000 dedicated window/door replacement companies (overlaps with siding contractors: 2,310 NAICS 238170, and general remodelers: 50,846).
- **Average Deal Size:** $8,000–$15,000 for whole-house window replacement; $3,000–$7,000 for entry doors.
- **Current Lead Gen:** TV/radio ads, home shows, door-to-door, Google Ads. Major brands like Renewal by Andersen dominate advertising, but installation is done by local dealers. **Broken because:** High-pressure sales tactics have trained consumers to avoid in-home consultations. A self-serve visualization tool removes friction.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES.** These companies have high customer acquisition costs ($200–$500/lead is normal). A widget that generates qualified leads from their website is excellent ROI.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **MEDIUM-HIGH.** Window/door detection on house facades is doable. Replacing them with different styles requires understanding of architectural proportions. More complex than paint, but feasible.

---

### 9. 🏊 Pool & Spa Builders
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their backyard → sees an inground pool, hot tub, or full pool/patio environment.

- **US Businesses:** ~10,000–15,000 pool builders/contractors (APSP members + independents). Highly fragmented — no single company has >2% market share.
- **Average Deal Size:** $35,000–$65,000 for inground pools; $8,000–$15,000 for hot tub installations with decking.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Google Ads, home shows, referrals, Houzz. **Broken because:** Pool projects have 6–12 month sales cycles. Customers browse for months. A visualization tool keeps them engaged and captures their info early.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES — at $200/mo, easily.** When your average deal is $50K, $200/mo for lead gen is literally nothing. Pool builders already spend $5,000–$15,000/mo on Google Ads.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **MEDIUM.** Adding a pool to a backyard photo requires understanding of ground topology and 3D perspective. Not trivial, but AI image generation can create compelling "concept renderings" that show pools in-context. Doesn't need to be architecturally precise to generate leads.

---

### 10. ☀️ Solar Panel Installers
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their roof → sees solar panels arranged on it with estimated panel count and rough energy output.

- **US Businesses:** ~10,000–12,000 solar installation companies (though consolidating — top 10 have ~30% share). Still highly fragmented at the local level.
- **Average Deal Size:** $15,000–$25,000 (before incentives).
- **Current Lead Gen:** Door-to-door (notorious), Google Ads, referrals, marketplace platforms (EnergySage). **Broken because:** Solar's biggest problem is consumer trust — too many pushy salespeople. A self-serve tool on a local installer's website builds trust.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES.** Customer acquisition cost in solar is $2,000–$5,000. Any tool that generates qualified leads is welcome.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **VERY HIGH.** Roof-plane detection + panel overlay is already well-proven (Google's Project Sunroof, Aurora Solar). But those are industry tools, not embeddable widgets for individual installer websites. There's a real gap here for the Vizzion model.

**Caveat:** Solar is consolidating faster than other trades. The market may be less fragmented in 3–5 years. Also, Aurora Solar exists and is well-funded, though they serve a different function (design/proposal tool, not website lead gen widget).

---

### 11. 🛥️ Boat Customization / Marine Detailing & Wraps
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their boat → sees custom wrapping, gel coat colors, graphics, or detail packages applied.

- **US Businesses:** ~5,000–8,000 marine service/customization businesses (subset of boat dealers, marine repair, custom shops).
- **Average Deal Size:** $3,000–$10,000 for boat wraps; $5,000–$20,000+ for full custom paint/gel coat.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Boat show presence, marina partnerships, Facebook groups. **Broken because:** Extremely niche — customers have few ways to visualize custom work on their specific boat model.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES for the larger shops.** High-ticket, visual product, and these businesses tend to be early digital adopters (heavy Instagram/Facebook use).
- **Technical Feasibility:** **MEDIUM-HIGH.** Similar to vehicle wraps but boats have more varied hull shapes. Could work well for color changes and wrap patterns; more complex for custom graphics.

---

### 12. 🏢 Commercial Signage & Storefront Graphics
**Visualization:** Business owner uploads photo of their storefront → sees different signage options (channel letters, awnings, window graphics, monument signs) mocked up on their building.

- **US Businesses:** ~15,000–25,000 sign companies (ISA has 2,600+ members; broader market includes print shops doing signage).
- **Average Deal Size:** $2,000–$10,000 for storefront signage; $5,000–$25,000+ for monument signs and full building graphics.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Google, referrals, cold outreach to new businesses. **Broken because:** Sign companies currently do free mockups in design software — time-intensive and often for prospects who don't buy. Sound familiar?
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES.** This is extremely parallel to the vehicle wrap use case. Sign companies already do manual visualization and would love to automate it while capturing leads.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **HIGH.** Building facade detection + signage overlay is straightforward. Flat surfaces, consistent lighting, well-defined placement areas.

---

## TIER 3 — INTERESTING BUT HARDER (Longer-term opportunities)

---

### 13. 💍 Custom Jewelry Design
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their hand → sees a custom ring (engagement, wedding band) on their finger. Or uploads a stone and sees it in different settings.

- **US Businesses:** 1,529 jewelry manufacturers (NAICS 339910) + ~25,000 independent jewelers. Many are moving to custom design as differentiation from online retailers.
- **Average Deal Size:** $2,000–$10,000 for engagement rings; $500–$3,000 for custom pieces.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Foot traffic (declining), Google, Instagram, bridal shows. **Broken because:** Online jewelry shopping is massive but the custom segment struggles — people want to see how it looks on THEIR hand.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **MAYBE.** Independent jewelers are not tech-forward and margins are being compressed. The ones doing custom work online would pay; traditional brick-and-mortar less likely.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **MEDIUM.** Ring-on-hand visualization exists in AR apps. The challenge is rendering realistic gemstones and metallic surfaces. Photo-realistic quality matters more here than in trades.

---

### 14. 💇 Hair Color / Style Preview (Beauty Salons)
**Visualization:** Customer uploads a selfie → sees themselves with different hair colors, highlights, balayage styles, or cuts.

- **US Businesses:** 125,440 beauty salons (NAICS 812112) — massive market.
- **Average Deal Size:** $100–$400 per color service. Lower ticket than trades, but very high frequency.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Instagram, Google, walk-ins, word of mouth. **Broken because:** Hair color is the single most anxiety-inducing beauty decision. "Will this look good on ME?" is the universal question.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **HONESTLY TOUGH.** The deal size is low ($150–350/visit). At $100/mo, a salon needs to attribute 1 extra client per month to break even. Possible but hard to prove. Also, L'Oreal and ModiFace already offer AR hair color try-on tools — though they're brand-specific, not lead gen widgets for individual salons.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **HIGH (already exists).** L'Oreal's ModiFace has proven this. The question is whether Vizzion can compete technically. The lead-gen wrapper is the differentiator.

**Verdict:** Enormous market, but low ticket and existing competition from big beauty brands' own tools.

---

### 15. 🐕 Pet Grooming (Creative Grooming / Luxury Styling)
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their dog → sees different grooming styles (breed cuts, creative coloring, luxury styling) applied.

- **US Businesses:** 32,943 pet care businesses (NAICS 812910); substantial subset are groomers.
- **Average Deal Size:** $50–$150 per grooming session. Some luxury/creative grooming: $100–$300.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Google, Yelp, social media. **Broken because:** Owners don't know what grooming style to request. Photos of other dogs don't translate to THEIR dog.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **NO — Honest assessment.** Deal size is too low. At $75/groom, a groomer needs 1-3 extra clients per month just to break even on a $100/mo tool. Most groomers are booked solid anyway — their problem isn't lead gen, it's capacity.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **MEDIUM.** Dog breed variation makes this harder than it sounds. A poodle and a golden retriever have very different "canvases" for grooming visualization.

**Verdict:** Fun concept, bad unit economics. Skip unless entering as a purely freemium/viral play.

---

### 16. 🏛️ Church / Nonprofit Facility Upgrades
**Visualization:** Church board uploads photo of their building → sees exterior renovation concepts (new signage, facade updates, accessibility ramps, stained glass restoration).

- **US Businesses:** ~380,000 churches/religious organizations in the US; ~100,000+ active nonprofits with physical facilities.
- **Average Deal Size:** $10,000–$100,000+ for facility renovations (wide range).
- **Current Lead Gen:** Contractor outreach, denominational networks, Google searches. **Broken because:** Decision-making is by committee. Visuals are critical for building consensus among board members/congregations.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **NOT THE CHURCHES — but the contractors selling to them would.** The buyer for Vizzion here is the contractor specializing in church/institutional renovation, not the church itself. Small market of specialized contractors.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **MEDIUM-HIGH.** Same as general exterior renovation visualization.

---

### 17. 🎪 Event Venues / Wedding Venues
**Visualization:** Couple uploads photo of a venue space → sees it decorated for their event (color schemes, floral arrangements, lighting, seating layouts, draping).

- **US Businesses:** ~15,000–20,000 wedding/event venues (estimated from The Knot/WeddingWire listings). Highly fragmented.
- **Average Deal Size:** $5,000–$15,000 for venue rental; $2,000–$5,000 for decoration/styling on top.
- **Current Lead Gen:** The Knot, WeddingWire (dominant marketplaces), Instagram, bridal shows. **Broken because:** Venue tours are time-intensive. Couples visit 3–5 venues. If they could visualize their event at a venue before visiting, it accelerates decisions.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES, but...** Venues would love this, but the visualization is complex (interior decoration rendering is harder than exterior overlays). If you could deliver it, $200/mo is easy for venues spending $2K–$5K/mo on advertising.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **MEDIUM.** Interior space + decoration rendering is more complex than exterior overlays. Lighting, draping, floral arrangements — lots of detail. Could work as a "style mood board overlay" rather than photorealistic rendering.

---

### 18. 🚜 Farm Buildings / Barns / Steel Buildings
**Visualization:** Farmer/rancher uploads photo of their property → sees a new barn, steel building, workshop, or agricultural structure placed on their land.

- **US Businesses:** ~5,000–10,000 steel building dealers/barn builders. Companies like Morton Buildings, Lester Buildings, and hundreds of regional dealers.
- **Average Deal Size:** $30,000–$100,000+ for agricultural buildings; $15,000–$50,000 for residential post-frame buildings.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Farm shows, dealer networks, Google, agriculture publications. **Broken because:** Extremely high ticket with long sales cycles. Farmers want to see the building on THEIR property before committing $50K+.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES — for the dealers.** Building manufacturers and their dealer networks would pay this easily. One additional sale per year more than justifies annual cost.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **HIGH.** Placing a 3D building model on a photo of flat farmland is one of the easier visualization tasks. Ground plane is flat, building shapes are standardized.

---

### 19. 🚿 Bathroom/Kitchen Remodeling (Cabinet Refacing, Countertops)
**Visualization:** Customer uploads photo of their kitchen → sees new cabinet fronts, countertop materials, and backsplash options applied.

- **US Businesses:** 50,846 residential remodelers (NAICS 236118) + cabinet/countertop-specific businesses. Kitchen & bath segment is ~$80B annually.
- **Average Deal Size:** $15,000–$40,000 for full kitchen remodel; $5,000–$10,000 for cabinet refacing; $3,000–$8,000 for countertops.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Google Ads, Houzz, showrooms, HomeAdvisor. **Broken because:** Showrooms show generic setups. Customers want to see materials in THEIR kitchen layout.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **YES.** This overlaps heavily with existing home improvement vertical. Kitchen/bath remodelers are the heart of the market.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **MEDIUM-HIGH.** Cabinet detection and texture replacement is doable. Countertop surface replacement (especially granite/quartz patterns) requires good material rendering. Harder than paint, easier than full 3D modeling.

**Note:** This is adjacent to Vizzion's current home improvement focus but specifically targeting the kitchen/bath niche could be a vertical expansion.

---

### 20. 🏠 Home Staging / Virtual Staging
**Visualization:** Real estate agent uploads photo of an empty room → sees it staged with furniture and decor.

- **US Businesses:** ~6,000–8,000 home staging companies + ~2M real estate agents (only a subset care about staging). Virtual staging companies already exist (BoxBrownie, VirtualStagingSolutions).
- **Average Deal Size:** $150–$500 per room (virtual staging); $2,000–$5,000 for physical staging per home.
- **Current Lead Gen:** Real estate agent referrals, MLS presence. **Broken because:** Virtual staging already exists and is cheap ($30–75/photo), but the tools are for the stager, not for the agent's website as a lead gen tool.
- **Would they pay $50–200/mo?** **COMPETITION CONCERN.** Virtual staging is a crowded market. BoxBrownie charges $32/image. The lead-gen angle (agent embeds widget, visitor uploads their empty home, sees it staged, enters email) is different but less obvious value prop.
- **Technical Feasibility:** **VERY HIGH.** Virtual staging is one of the most mature AI visualization categories. Multiple companies already do this with excellent quality.

**Verdict:** Technically easy, but existing competition is fierce and the lead-gen angle is less natural than in trades.

## TOP 5 RECOMMENDED VERTICALS TO PURSUE

1. **Vehicle Wraps** — Perfect product-market fit. Small, visual, high-ticket, manual mockups today. TAM: 5K–8K shops × $150/mo = $9M–$14M ARR potential.

2. **Fencing Contractors** — Large fragmented market, clear visualization need, high ticket, no good existing tool. TAM: 20K–30K × $100/mo = $24M–$36M ARR potential.

3. **House Painting** — Largest addressable market with proven visualization technology. Differentiation from brand-specific tools (Sherwin-Williams) by being a lead gen widget. TAM: 30K × $100/mo = $36M ARR potential.

4. **Flooring** — Easiest technical implementation. Massive fragmented market of independent dealers/installers. TAM: 13K+ × $100/mo = $15M+ ARR potential.

5. **Commercial Signage** — Underserved, parallel to vehicle wraps, clear value prop of replacing manual mockups. TAM: 15K–25K × $150/mo = $27M–$45M ARR potential.

---

## KEY INSIGHT: THE "MOCKUP REPLACEMENT" ANGLE

The strongest Vizzion industries share a common thread: **businesses that currently do manual mockups/renderings for prospects.** Vehicle wrap shops, sign companies, painters, and landscapers all spend significant time creating free visualizations for leads who may not convert. Vizzion doesn't just generate leads — it **replaces labor** while generating leads. That's a much easier sell than "just another lead gen tool."

**Pitch angle:** "Stop wasting 2 hours doing free mockups for tire-kickers. Let them see the result on their own photo — and give you their email to get the full design."
