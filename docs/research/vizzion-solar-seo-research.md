## 5. Solar Industry Pain Points

### The Macro Challenge: Lead Generation is the #1 Pain Point

Based on industry research, forums, competitor messaging, and SEIA data:

**The residential solar market is under pressure:**
- The 25D tax credit is ending/changing, creating uncertainty
- High interest rates have dampened demand since 2023
- California NEM 3.0 changes disrupted the largest market
- Customer acquisition costs (CAC) have skyrocketed — averaging **$3,000–$6,000 per residential install**
- Lead quality from third-party sources (bought leads) is declining

### Top Pain Points Solar Installers Express

#### 1. "We're spending a fortune on leads that don't convert"
**Language they use:**
- "Garbage leads"
- "Tire kickers"
- "Leads that don't pick up the phone"
- "Paying $50+ per lead and only closing 5-10%"
- "Lead vendors are killing our margins"
- "We need EXCLUSIVE leads, not shared ones"

**Vizzion angle:** Your own website generates exclusive, self-qualified leads for free.

#### 2. "Our website doesn't generate any business"
**Language they use:**
- "We get traffic but no one fills out the form"
- "Nobody wants to give their info for a 'free quote'"
- "Our website is basically a brochure"
- "We're paying for SEO/Google Ads but not getting leads"

**Vizzion angle:** Transform your website from a digital brochure into a lead generation machine.

#### 3. "Homeowners don't understand what solar looks like on THEIR house"
**Language they use:**
- "They can't visualize it"
- "We need to show them what their roof would look like"
- "The biggest objection is aesthetic — they're afraid it'll look ugly"
- "If they could see it, they'd buy it"

**Vizzion angle:** Let homeowners see solar on their own roof before you ever pick up the phone.

#### 4. "We're losing deals to competitors who engage faster"
**Language they use:**
- "Speed to lead is everything"
- "If we don't call back within 5 minutes, they've already talked to someone else"
- "The first company to engage wins"
- "We need to capture interest the moment they're thinking about solar"

**Vizzion angle:** Capture interest 24/7, the moment a homeowner is curious — even at 2 AM on a Sunday.

#### 5. "It's hard to stand out from other solar companies"
**Language they use:**
- "Every solar company's website looks the same"
- "We all say the same things — save money, go green"
- "How do we differentiate?"
- "We need something that makes us look cutting-edge"

**Vizzion angle:** Be the only solar company in your market with an interactive visualization tool on your website.

#### 6. "We can't scale our sales team fast enough"
**Language they use:**
- "Good solar reps are hard to find"
- "Training takes months"
- "We need more appointments, not more reps"
- "Our reps spend too much time on unqualified prospects"

**Vizzion angle:** Pre-qualify prospects before your sales team ever picks up the phone. Every lead has already shown interest by visualizing solar on their home.

#### 7. "Our close rate is dropping"
**Language they use:**
- "Close rates used to be 30-40%, now we're at 15-20%"
- "Homeowners are shopping 5-6 companies"
- "The market is more competitive than ever"
- "We need to build trust faster"

**Vizzion angle:** Leads who've already seen solar on their roof are warmer, more engaged, and easier to close.

### Industry-Specific Terms to Use in Copy
- **Lead to PTO** (Permission To Operate) — the full solar customer journey
- **CAC** (Customer Acquisition Cost)
- **Speed to lead** — how fast you respond to an inquiry
- **Sit rate** — percentage of leads that result in an in-home appointment
- **Close rate** — percentage of appointments that become sales

## Key Takeaways & Strategic Summary

### Vizzion's Unique Position
Vizzion fills a gap that NO major solar software competitor addresses: **converting anonymous website traffic into identified leads through interactive visualization.** Aurora, OpenSolar, Solargraf, and Enerflo all focus on what happens AFTER you have a lead. Vizzion owns the critical moment BEFORE.

### Messaging Hierarchy (Most to Least Important)
1. **Lead generation** — "Turn visitors into leads" (this is what they're buying)
2. **Simplicity** — "5-minute setup, one line of code" (this removes friction)
3. **Visualization** — "Homeowners see solar on their own roof" (this is the mechanism)
4. **Email capture** — "Get their email before the visualization" (this is the clever part)
5. **Differentiation** — "Be the only solar company in your market with this" (competitive advantage)

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Show, don't tell** — An interactive demo or video is worth more than any copy
2. **Lead with the outcome** (more leads) not the technology (AI visualization)
3. **Use solar industry language** — "self-gen leads," "speed to lead," "close rate"
