# Vizzion.io — Consolidated Industry Expansion Report
## Cross-Validated Analysis from 4 Independent Research Angles

**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Last Updated:** February 7, 2026

---

## 📊 Implementation Status

> **This report was research. Below is what was actually decided and built.**

### Decision: 17 Industries Selected
Trey chose **17 industries** spanning property, vehicle, and body transformations — broadening Vizzion beyond "home improvement" to **"any business that sells visual transformations."**

### Industries LIVE (6 pages built and deployed):
- ☀️ Solar → `/industries/solar`
- 🚗 Car/Vehicle Wraps → `/industries/car-wraps`
- 💈 Tattoos → `/industries/tattoos`
- 🏊 Swimming Pools → `/industries/swimming-pools`
- 🌱 Artificial Turf → `/industries/artificial-turf`
- 🚤 Boat Decking → `/industries/boat-decking`

### Industries PLANNED (11 pages to build):
- 🏠 Roofing
- 🏠 Siding
- 🪟 Windows & Doors
- 🪵 Decking
- 🧱 Fencing
- 🌿 Landscaping
- 🎨 Painting
- 🪣 Gutters
- 🚪 Garage Doors
- 🎄 Outdoor Lighting
- 🏠 Flooring/Countertops

### Key Positioning Shift
The report below frames Vizzion as a "home improvement" tool. **That framing is now outdated.** Vizzion's actual positioning: *"Any business that sells visual transformations — property, vehicle, or body."* The 5 non-home industries (car wraps, tattoos, swimming pools, artificial turf, boat decking) reflect this broader vision.

### What Diverged from Recommendations
- **Solar** was listed as Tier 2 in this report but was built first (strong market demand, proved the template pattern)
- **Swimming Pools, Artificial Turf, Boat Decking** were Tier 2–3 in this report but were elevated because they matched the "visual transformation" thesis perfectly
- **Commercial Signage** (Tier 1 in report) was NOT selected for the initial 17
- **Flooring/Countertops** was listed as "AVOID as lead vertical" but is included as one of 17 — positioned as a bundle add-on, not a standalone play against Roomvo
- **Boat Decking** wasn't in the original research at all — Trey identified it as a gap

**Source Reports:**
1. **Visualization Anxiety** — 24 industries analyzed through the lens of "can't picture it" killing sales
2. **Fragmented B2B Markets** — 20 industries analyzed through the lens of fragmented small businesses willing to pay
3. **Emerging Trends** — 20 opportunities analyzed through 2026–2031 trend trajectories
4. **Consumer Psychology** — 20 industries analyzed through emotional purchase barriers and conversion psychology

---

## Executive Summary

**Total industries analyzed across all 4 reports:** 84 individual industry entries, which de-duplicate to **~40 unique industries/verticals** (many appeared across multiple reports — a strong validation signal).

**The single biggest insight:** There is an enormous, underserved "long tail" of **hundreds of thousands of small/mid businesses** across home services, personal services, and visual trades that (a) sell high-ticket visual transformations, (b) currently have ZERO visualization tools on their websites, and (c) already do manual mockups/renderings that Vizzion could automate. The existing competitors (Roomvo, Renoworks, ModiFace) serve enterprise manufacturers — leaving the 1.5M+ individual contractors, studios, and shops completely unserved. **Vizzion's white space is not a new technology — it's a new distribution model: affordable, embeddable, lead-gen-first visualization for the long tail.**

**TAM Opportunity:**
- **Addressable businesses in the US alone:** ~1.5M+ across all identified verticals
- **At $100–$200/month SMB pricing:** $1.8B–$3.6B annual TAM
- **Even 1% penetration (15,000 businesses × $100/mo):** $18M ARR
- **Global expansion multiplier:** 3–5x (UK, EU, Australia, Canada have identical market structures)

## Tier 1: Launch These — Top 10 Cross-Validated Industries

These industries appeared as top picks across **multiple independent research reports**, making them the highest-confidence targets.

---

### 1. 🏠 Exterior Home Remodeling (Siding, Stone Veneer, Stucco)

**Why it's a fit:** The single most severe visualization anxiety in home improvement. Homeowners are changing the "face" of their largest asset — a $400K house — based on 12"×12" samples. The emotional stakes (public visibility, neighborhood judgment, permanence) are extreme, and the ticket justifies significant per-lead value.

- **Average ticket:** $15,000–$45,000
- **US businesses:** ~35,000 siding/exterior contractors
- **Competition:** **Moderate** — Renoworks exists but serves enterprise manufacturers at premium pricing. The 35,000 individual contractors are completely unserved.
- **Cross-validation:** Ranked #1 in Visualization Anxiety, #3 in Consumer Psychology (🔥 Game-changer). Core to Emerging Trends (Green Retrofit angle).
- **Lead value:** $50–$100+ per qualified lead

---

### 2. 🎨 Exterior House Painting

**Why it's a fit:** The largest addressable market by business count (300K+ painters), with proven visualization technology (color swapping is the easiest AI use case), and brand-locked existing tools (Sherwin-Williams, Benjamin Moore) that don't capture leads for the painter. The "mockup replacement" angle is strongest here — painters currently show nothing.

- **Average ticket:** $3,000–$8,000
- **US businesses:** ~300,000 painting contractors
- **Competition:** **Low** — Brand tools exist (ColorSnap, Color Portfolio) but are manufacturer-locked and don't capture leads for contractors. No embeddable widget for painters.
- **Cross-validation:** Ranked #4 in Visualization Anxiety, #3 (A+) in Fragmented Markets, #11 in Consumer Psychology. Appeared in all 4 reports.
- **Lead value:** $30–$75 per qualified lead

---

### 3. 🌿 Hardscaping & Landscape Design

**Why it's a fit:** Every yard is different — making "see it on MY property" extraordinarily valuable. The market is enormous ($130B landscaping, ~$26B hardscaping), highly fragmented (600K+ landscaping businesses), and current visualization tools are either professional-grade ($500–$2,000 per rendering) or nonexistent. Contractors desperately need lead gen.

- **Average ticket:** $5,000–$50,000+ (patios to full outdoor living spaces)
- **US businesses:** ~600,000 landscaping businesses (hardscape-focused subset ~100K+)
- **Competition:** **Low** — iScape is consumer-facing, PRO Landscape is professional software. No embeddable widget for contractor websites.
- **Cross-validation:** Ranked #5 in Visualization Anxiety, #4 (A) in Fragmented Markets, #11 (9/10) in Emerging Trends, #5 (🔥 Game-changer) in Consumer Psychology. **Appeared in ALL 4 reports as a top pick.**
- **Lead value:** $50–$150+ per qualified lead

---

### 4. 🧱 Fencing

**Why it's a fit:** One of the clearest product-market fits: high ticket, zero existing competition, high visualization need (every property line is different), and contractors compete fiercely for leads on expensive aggregator platforms ($30–$80/lead from HomeAdvisor). A visualization widget is a massive differentiator.

- **Average ticket:** $3,000–$15,000
- **US businesses:** ~20,000–50,000 fence contractors
- **Competition:** **NONE** — Essentially zero interactive visualization tools exist in this entire industry. A complete greenfield.
- **Cross-validation:** Ranked #6 in Visualization Anxiety, #2 (A+) in Fragmented Markets, #8 in Consumer Psychology. Appeared in 3 of 4 reports as a top pick.
- **Lead value:** $40–$100 per qualified lead

---

### 5. 💈 Tattoos

**Why it's a fit:** The ultimate "fear of regret" purchase — permanent, on your body, deeply personal. People agonize for months. The visualization gap is enormous and the entire purchase decision hinges on "can I see it on ME first?" Tattoo studios are digitally savvy (Instagram-native), and no embeddable widget exists. High viral potential.

- **Average ticket:** $200–$5,000+ (average ~$300 per session; large pieces much more)
- **US businesses:** ~24,000–35,000 tattoo studios
- **Competition:** **NONE embeddable** — InkHunter is a consumer app requiring download. No B2B embeddable widget for studio websites.
- **Cross-validation:** Ranked #10 in Visualization Anxiety, #7 (B+) in Fragmented Markets, #10 (8/10) in Emerging Trends, #1 (🔥 Game-changer) in Consumer Psychology. **Appeared in ALL 4 reports.**
- **Caution:** Lower ticket than home services; some studios may resist $100+/mo. Target premium studios first.

---

### 6. 🏗️ Roofing

**Why it's a fit:** The roof is 40% of a home's visible exterior, yet homeowners pick colors from 6-inch samples. The "default black" phenomenon (choosing safe/boring because they can't visualize) costs the industry billions in lost upsell revenue. 100K+ contractors, manufacturer tools are brand-locked, and per-lead value is excellent.

- **Average ticket:** $8,000–$25,000 (shingles); $15,000–$50,000 (metal/tile)
- **US businesses:** ~100,000+ roofing contractors
- **Competition:** **Low** — GAF and Owens Corning have proprietary visualizers locked to their products. Independent contractors have nothing.
- **Cross-validation:** Ranked #2 in Visualization Anxiety, #18 in Consumer Psychology. Referenced in Emerging Trends (Green Retrofit).
- **Lead value:** $100–$200+ per qualified lead

---

### 7. 🚗 Vehicle Wraps & Custom Auto

**Why it's a fit:** Wrap shops currently waste hours doing manual Photoshop mockups for prospects who may not convert. Vizzion doesn't just generate leads — it **replaces labor**. That's the strongest sell across all industries. High ticket, growing 20%+/year, zero widget competition, and shops are already digitally active on Instagram.

- **Average ticket:** $2,500–$5,000 (personal); $3,000–$10,000 (commercial fleet)
- **US businesses:** ~5,000–15,000 wrap/graphics shops
- **Competition:** **NONE widget** — 3M has a basic visualizer showing generic vehicle models, not YOUR vehicle. No embeddable widget for shops.
- **Cross-validation:** Ranked #13 in Visualization Anxiety, #1 (A+) in Fragmented Markets, #16 in Emerging Trends, #7 in Consumer Psychology. **Appeared in ALL 4 reports.**

---

### 8. 🪟 Windows & Doors

**Why it's a fit:** Windows and doors define a home's character. At $15K–$50K for whole-house replacement, the ticket is enormous and customer acquisition costs are already $200–$500/lead. Companies rely on high-pressure in-home consultations — a self-serve visualization widget removes friction and pre-qualifies leads.

- **Average ticket:** $8,000–$50,000
- **US businesses:** ~10,000–50,000 window/door dealers and installers
- **Competition:** **Low** — Pella has a proprietary visualizer. Most dealers have nothing photo-based.
- **Cross-validation:** Ranked #3 in Visualization Anxiety, #8 (A-) in Fragmented Markets, #4 in Consumer Psychology. Appeared in 3 of 4 reports.

---

### 9. 🎄 Holiday & Permanent Exterior Lighting

**Why it's a fit:** A booming industry with ZERO visualization tools. Homeowners can't picture what 2,000 LED lights look like on their roofline. Permanent lighting systems (Trimlight, Jellyfish) are a $3K–$8K commitment growing 30%+ annually. Seasonal urgency creates strong conversion pressure. "See your house lit up" is an incredibly compelling emotional hook.

- **Average ticket:** $1,500–$5,000 (seasonal); $3,000–$8,000 (permanent systems)
- **US businesses:** ~5,000+ lighting companies (growing fast)
- **Competition:** **NONE** — Some companies do manual Photoshop mockups. Zero interactive tools exist. Complete greenfield.
- **Cross-validation:** Ranked #18 in Visualization Anxiety, #5 (9/10) in Emerging Trends, #16 in Consumer Psychology. Appeared in 3 of 4 reports. **Every report noted zero competition.**

---

### 10. 🏢 Commercial Signage & Storefront Design

**Why it's a fit:** Sign companies currently do manual Photoshop mockups for every prospect — time-intensive and often wasted on non-buyers. The "mockup replacement" value proposition is identical to vehicle wraps. High ticket, clear visualization need ("how will this sign look on MY building?"), and a large fragmented market.

- **Average ticket:** $3,000–$100,000+ (storefront signs to monument signs)
- **US businesses:** ~15,000–25,000 sign companies
- **Competition:** **Low** — SignVOX and similar tools are internal design software, not customer-facing widgets. Most sign companies show flat PDF proofs.
- **Cross-validation:** Ranked #14 in Visualization Anxiety, #12 (A-) in Fragmented Markets, #12 (8/10) in Emerging Trends. Appeared in 3 of 4 reports.

---

## Tier 2: Strong Potential — Next 10

These are strong opportunities that need slightly more validation or have specific caveats.

---

### 11. ☀️ Solar Panels
High ticket ($15K–$30K), aesthetic concern is the #2 objection, and roof-plane detection is proven technology. Customer acquisition costs are astronomical ($2K–$5K). **Caveat:** Aurora Solar is well-funded and the industry is consolidating. Position as a lightweight lead gen widget, not a design tool.
- **Reports:** Visualization Anxiety, Fragmented Markets, Emerging Trends (EV/Green Retrofit angle)

### 12. 🍳 Kitchen Remodel (Cabinets, Countertops, Backsplash)
Kitchen is the #1 most expensive room to remodel (avg $27K). Visualization would reduce decision paralysis across cabinets, countertops, and backsplash — all chosen from tiny samples. **Caveat:** Roomvo covers some countertop brands; the broader kitchen visualization is technically more complex.
- **Reports:** Visualization Anxiety (#8 countertops, #20 cabinets, #22 tile), Fragmented Markets (#19), Consumer Psychology (#9)

### 13. 🏊 Swimming Pools
Highest ticket of any vertical ($50K–$150K) with highest customer acquisition costs ($500–$1,500/lead). Pool builders would pay premium pricing. **Caveat:** Placing a pool into a backyard photo is more technically complex than surface swaps. Pool *renovation* (replastering/retiling existing pools) is much easier.
- **Reports:** Visualization Anxiety, Fragmented Markets, Consumer Psychology

### 14. 🪵 Decking & Pergolas
$10B market, 40K+ deck builders, and the material choice (Trex "Spiced Rum" vs "Foggy Wharf") dramatically changes aesthetics. Composite decking brands have weak configurators. **Caveat:** Moderate technical complexity for perspective-accurate overlays on outdoor ground planes.
- **Reports:** Visualization Anxiety (#7)

### 15. 💇 Hair Color & Styling
Enormous emotional stakes ("what if I go blonde and it's terrible?") and massive market (1M+ salons, $48B industry). ModiFace proves the tech works. **Caveat:** ModiFace (owned by L'Oréal) is a serious competitor, and per-service ticket ($150–$400) makes $100/mo harder to justify for small salons. Target premium salons and colorists.
- **Reports:** Visualization Anxiety, Fragmented Markets, Consumer Psychology (🔥 Game-changer)

### 16. 🪟 Window Treatments (Blinds, Shutters, Drapes)
$12B market with 30K+ retailers, high visualization need, and franchise-ready distribution (Budget Blinds = 1,000+ locations). **Caveat:** Hunter Douglas has some tools. But the franchise deployment opportunity is compelling.
- **Reports:** Visualization Anxiety, Emerging Trends (#17, 9/10 fit)

### 17. 🏘️ Artificial Turf
ZERO competition, simple use case (grass texture replacement), growing rapidly especially in drought-prone states. Addresses the #1 objection ("it'll look fake"). **Caveat:** Smaller market (~10K installers) but growing fast.
- **Reports:** Visualization Anxiety (#21, rated NONE competition + ★★★★★ feasibility)

### 18. 💉 Cosmetic Procedures (Rhinoplasty, Fillers, Veneers)
Combined cosmetic surgery + dentistry. Patients spend $500–$50K and the "what will I look like?" question drives 90% of consultations. Existing solutions (Crisalix, DSD) are $5K–$50K enterprise tools. **Caveat:** Medical/ethical sensitivity requires careful marketing. Focus on med spas and cosmetic dentists.
- **Reports:** Emerging Trends (#3 dental, #13 plastic surgery), Consumer Psychology (#6, #13)

### 19. 🚪 Garage Doors
30–40% of a home's front-facing visual. Clopay's "Door Imagination System" proves massive demand — but most local installers have nothing. Perfect simple overlay use case. **Caveat:** Smaller market (~$5B) and lower ticket ($2K–$8K).
- **Reports:** Consumer Psychology (#15)

### 20. 🏠 ADUs & Prefab Backyard Structures
Highest individual ticket ($100K–$300K) of any vertical. ADU legislation is exploding nationwide. Companies desperately need tools to help customers envision the structure in their yard. **Caveat:** Placing a 3D building into a 2D photo is technically harder than surface swaps.
- **Reports:** Visualization Anxiety (#23), Emerging Trends (#2, 9/10 fit), Consumer Psychology (#17)

---

## Tier 3: Watch List

Interesting opportunities that are either too early, too niche, too competitive, or need the right conditions.

---

### 21. 🌱 Green Building Retrofit / EV Charger Visualization
Government incentive spending (IRA) is creating billions in demand. Comprehensive "whole home retrofit" visualization is unserved. **Watch because:** Market is still maturing and customer education is needed. Could become massive in 2–3 years.
- **Reports:** Emerging Trends (#1 EV, #7 Green Retrofit — both 9/10)

### 22. 💐 Wedding & Event Venue Decoration
$70B wedding industry, deeply emotional purchases, and couples rely on mood boards. Florists and planners who can SHOW the vision close at higher rates. **Watch because:** Interior decoration rendering is more complex, and each event is highly custom.
- **Reports:** Fragmented Markets (#17), Emerging Trends (#8), Consumer Psychology (#10)

### 23. 💎 Jewelry (On-Person Try-On)
$60B market, strong "how will it look on ME?" need. **Watch because:** Small objects on body parts require precise scale/rendering. More technically challenging, and some AR try-on competitors exist.
- **Reports:** Visualization Anxiety (#24), Fragmented Markets (#13)

### 24. 🛋️ Wall Art, Murals & Large-Format Prints
One of the easiest technical use cases (rectangular image on flat wall). $12B+ market. **Watch because:** Lower ticket ($100–$2K typically) and some basic AR tools already exist (Art.com, iArtView). Better as an add-on feature than a primary vertical.
- **Reports:** Visualization Anxiety (#16), Consumer Psychology (#19)

### 25. 🚜 Farm Buildings / Steel Buildings / Barns
High ticket ($30K–$100K+), flat farmland makes placement easy, and building dealers would pay. **Watch because:** Niche market, longer sales cycles, and requires 3D structure placement.
- **Reports:** Fragmented Markets (#18, B+)

### 26. 🏥 Hearing Aids & Wearable Medical Devices
Zero competition, vanity is the #1 adoption barrier, and OTC revolution is creating a new consumer market. **Watch because:** Niche market with concentrated manufacturers. Could be a compelling white-label deal with one brand.
- **Reports:** Emerging Trends (#19, 7/10)

### 27. 🌊 Stormwater / Rain Garden / Green Infrastructure
Growing 12–15% annually from municipal mandates. Zero consumer-facing visualization. **Watch because:** Market is still very early and niche. Monitor for 1–2 years.
- **Reports:** Emerging Trends (#14)

### 28. 🏙️ Municipal / Urban Planning Community Visualization
Great social impact use case. **Watch because:** Government sales cycles are long and complex. Better as a long-term strategic play.
- **Reports:** Emerging Trends (#9)

---

## Biggest Surprises

The most unexpected/non-obvious finds across all reports:

1. **Tattoos as a Tier 1 opportunity** — Every report independently identified tattoos as high-potential. The "permanent identity on your body" visualization anxiety is arguably the most intense of any purchase. The market is large (24K+ studios), growing 11% CAGR, and has ZERO embeddable competition. The surprise: tattoo studios are more digitally savvy than most home service contractors (they live on Instagram).

2. **Holiday lighting as a zero-competition goldmine** — Three reports independently flagged this as a completely unserved market with strong growth. Professional holiday lighting is a $1.5B+ industry growing 10–15% annually, and permanent outdoor lighting systems (Trimlight, Jellyfish) are growing 30%+. Nobody has any visualization tool. The seasonal urgency creates natural conversion pressure.

3. **The "mockup replacement" angle is more powerful than "lead gen"** — The Fragmented Markets report surfaced a critical insight: the strongest pitch isn't "generate leads" — it's "stop wasting hours on free mockups for tire-kickers." Vehicle wrap shops, sign companies, and landscape designers spend hours creating free renderings that don't convert. Vizzion automates mockups AND captures leads. Double value proposition.

4. **Dental cosmetic visualization is wide open** — Multiple reports identified the gap between expensive clinical tools (Crisalix at $20K+, DSD) and the consumer-facing web experience. No embeddable "upload a smile selfie → see your veneers" widget exists. Cosmetic dentists spend $50K–$500K/year on marketing and a qualified lead who's already visualized their outcome is worth $500–$5,000.

5. **The franchise/chain deployment opportunity** — Budget Blinds (1,000+ locations), Renewal by Andersen, SERVPRO, various franchise painting companies — deploying a widget across an entire franchise network through a single deal could mean thousands of locations instantly. This distribution model wasn't highlighted until the Emerging Trends report connected the dots.

---

## Strategic Themes

Patterns that emerged consistently across all 4 research angles:

### 1. The Long Tail is the Opportunity
Every report independently concluded that existing competitors (Roomvo, Renoworks, ModiFace) serve enterprise manufacturers — not the millions of individual contractors, studios, and shops. Vizzion's moat is affordability and accessibility for the long tail, not superior technology.

### 2. "Upload = Intent Signal" is the Lead Gen Goldmine
The Consumer Psychology report nailed it: someone who uploads a photo of their house/face/yard is expressing **dramatically more purchase intent** than someone who fills out a contact form. They're actively imagining themselves as a customer. The email capture at this moment catches them at peak emotional engagement. This insight should drive all marketing messaging.

### 3. Surface Swaps First, 3D Placement Later
The technically easiest and highest-value use cases are all **surface replacements** — changing colors/textures on existing surfaces (walls, roofs, floors, fences, vehicles). 3D object placement (pools, ADUs, furniture) is harder and can come in Phase 2. This creates a clear technical roadmap.

### 4. Fear of Regret > Fear of Cost
Across every high-performing vertical, the primary purchase barrier is NOT price — it's "what if I hate it?" Visualization directly neutralizes the #1 objection. This means Vizzion isn't just a lead gen tool — it's a **close rate amplifier**. Contractors who can show the result close more deals at higher margins (upsell from safe/boring to premium options).

### 5. The "Mockup Replacement" Pitch Wins
The most successful verticals are those where businesses **already do manual visualizations** (Photoshop mockups, design renderings, sample boards). Vizzion replaces labor cost while also capturing leads — a double value prop that makes ROI calculation trivially easy.

### 6. Seasonality Can Be an Advantage
Holiday lighting, landscaping, painting, and roofing are seasonal businesses with compressed selling windows. Visualization tools that accelerate decisions during peak season are disproportionately valuable.

## Industries to AVOID

### ❌ Pet Grooming
- **Why:** Average ticket ($50–$150) is far too low to justify $100+/mo SaaS. Most groomers are capacity-constrained, not lead-constrained. Unit economics don't work. Rated "D" in Fragmented Markets report.

### ❌ Flooring as a Primary Vertical
- **Why:** Roomvo is the dominant, well-funded incumbent with 6,000+ brand partners, multiple industry awards, and proven 5x conversion increases. Entering as "another flooring visualizer" is a losing strategy. Use flooring as a "we also do floors" add-on capability, never as the lead vertical.

### ❌ Virtual Home Staging
- **Why:** Crowded market (BoxBrownie, VirtualStagingSolutions, roOomy, etc.) with race-to-the-bottom pricing ($30–$75/image). The lead-gen angle is less natural than in trades. Rated "C" in Fragmented Markets.

### ❌ General Furniture / Interior Design
- **Why:** Amazon, Wayfair, IKEA, and Houzz all have "view in your room" AR features. Big tech budgets, entrenched solutions, and the ticket per individual furniture piece is low. Don't compete with Amazon's AR.

### ❌ Hair Salons at Scale (Budget Tier)
- **Why:** While hair color visualization is compelling, the per-service ticket ($100–$400) makes it extremely hard for budget-tier salons to justify monthly SaaS. L'Oréal/ModiFace is a well-funded competitor. Only pursue premium salons and high-end colorists if entering this space.

### ❌ Churches / Nonprofits (Direct)
- **Why:** Long procurement cycles, budget constraints, committee decision-making. The buyer is the contractor selling TO the church, not the church itself. Tiny addressable market of specialized contractors.

## Recommended Launch Sequence

**Phase 1 (Months 1–3): Prove the Model**
Start with 2–3 verticals that share the same technical capability (exterior surface swaps):
- **Exterior Painting** — Easiest technically, largest market, clear ROI pitch
- **Fencing** — Zero competition, high ticket, strong lead demand
- **Holiday Lighting** — Zero competition, seasonal urgency, high viral potential

**Phase 2 (Months 4–6): Expand the Exterior Home Bundle**
- **Siding/Stone Veneer** — Same tech as painting, higher ticket
- **Roofing** — Same tech, enormous market
- **Garage Doors** — Simple overlay, add to the "exterior home" bundle

**Phase 3 (Months 7–12): New Surface Categories**
- **Vehicle Wraps + Signage** — Different surface (vehicles/buildings) but same overlay tech
- **Tattoos** — Body surface, different tech but high engagement and viral potential
- **Hardscaping** — Ground-plane overlays, technically adjacent

**Phase 4 (Year 2): Advanced Visualization**
- **ADUs / Pools** — 3D object placement
- **Kitchen/Bath** — Interior surface swaps
- **Cosmetic / Dental** — Facial transformation (specialized AI)

**Wildcard (Parallel Track):**
- **Marketplace White-Label** — Pursue one platform partnership (Thumbtack, Houzz, Angi) as infrastructure. One deal = instant scale across all verticals.
